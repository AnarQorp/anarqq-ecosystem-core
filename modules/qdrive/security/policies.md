# Qdrive Security Policies

This document outlines the security policies and requirements for the Qdrive file storage module.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Identity Verification (sQuid Integration)

All file operations require valid sQuid identity verification:

```javascript
// Required headers for all requests
{
  "x-squid-id": "squid_abc123def456",
  "x-subid": "sub_789xyz",  // Optional
  "x-sig": "qlock_signature_here",
  "x-ts": "1642248600000",
  "Authorization": "Bearer jwt_token_here"
}
```

**Policy Requirements**:
- All requests MUST include valid sQuid identity
- Signatures MUST be verified using Qlock
- Timestamps MUST be within 5 minutes of current time
- JWT tokens MUST be valid and not expired

### Access Control (Qonsent Integration)

File access is controlled through Qonsent policies:

**File Upload Policy**:
```json
{
  "resource": "qdrive:file:upload",
  "action": "create",
  "conditions": {
    "identity_verified": true,
    "storage_quota_available": true,
    "file_size_within_limits": true
  }
}
```

**File Access Policy**:
```json
{
  "resource": "qdrive:file:{cid}",
  "action": "read",
  "conditions": {
    "owner": "{squid_id}",
    "OR": [
      {"privacy": "public"},
      {"shared_with": "{squid_id}"},
      {"dao_member": "{dao_id}"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**File Sharing Policy**:
```json
{
  "resource": "qdrive:file:{cid}",
  "action": "share",
  "conditions": {
    "owner": "{squid_id}",
    "file_exists": true,
    "recipients_valid": true,
    "sharing_limits_not_exceeded": true
  }
}
```

## Encryption Standards (Qlock Integration)

### File Encryption

All files are encrypted by default using Qlock:

**Encryption Requirements**:
- Algorithm: AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305
- Key derivation: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Unique IV/nonce for each file
- Authentication tag verification required

**Key Management**:
- Keys stored in KMS/HSM via Qlock
- Per-file encryption keys derived from master key
- Key rotation every 90 days
- Emergency key escrow for compliance

### Metadata Encryption

Sensitive metadata is also encrypted:

```javascript
// Encrypted metadata fields
const encryptedFields = [
  'description',
  'tags',
  'originalFilename'
];

// Public metadata (for indexing)
const publicFields = [
  'cid',
  'size',
  'mimeType',
  'createdAt',
  'privacy'
];
```

## Data Protection

### Privacy by Design

**Data Minimization**:
- Only collect necessary file metadata
- Automatic deletion of temporary files
- No tracking of user behavior beyond security requirements

**Purpose Limitation**:
- Files used only for stated storage purposes
- No content analysis without explicit consent
- Metadata sharing limited to necessary integrations

### GDPR Compliance

**Data Subject Rights**:
- Right to access: Users can list all their files
- Right to rectification: Metadata can be updated
- Right to erasure: Files can be deleted on request
- Right to portability: Files can be exported

**Consent Management**:
- Explicit consent for file processing
- Granular consent for sharing and analytics
- Easy consent withdrawal mechanisms

## Rate Limiting and Abuse Protection

### Upload Limits

**Per Identity Limits**:
- Free tier: 10 uploads per hour, 100 per day
- Basic plan: 100 uploads per hour, 1000 per day
- Premium plan: 500 uploads per hour, 5000 per day
- Enterprise: Custom limits

**File Size Limits**:
- Free tier: 10MB per file, 100MB total per day
- Basic plan: 100MB per file, 1GB total per day
- Premium plan: 1GB per file, 10GB total per day
- Enterprise: Custom limits

### Anti-Abuse Measures

**Content Scanning**:
- Virus scanning for all uploads
- Hash-based duplicate detection
- Suspicious file pattern detection
- Integration with Qerberos for threat analysis

**Behavioral Analysis**:
- Unusual upload patterns trigger alerts
- Rapid file deletion patterns monitored
- Sharing abuse detection (spam, malware distribution)
- IP-based rate limiting for anonymous access

## Audit and Monitoring

### Security Event Logging

All security-relevant events are logged to Qerberos:

```javascript
// Security events logged
const securityEvents = [
  'file_upload_attempt',
  'file_access_denied',
  'file_sharing_violation',
  'encryption_failure',
  'authentication_failure',
  'suspicious_activity_detected'
];
```

**Log Retention**:
- Security logs: 7 years
- Access logs: 2 years
- Error logs: 1 year
- Debug logs: 30 days

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Real-time Monitoring**:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual file access patterns
- Encryption/decryption failures
- Storage quota violations

**Alert Thresholds**:
- 5 failed auth attempts in 5 minutes
- 100 file accesses in 1 minute from single IP
- 10 encryption failures in 1 hour
- Storage usage >95% of quota

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

**Level 1 - Low**: Single user authentication failure
**Level 2 - Medium**: Multiple failed authentications, suspicious file patterns
**Level 3 - High**: Potential data breach, malware detection
**Level 4 - Critical**: Confirmed data breach, system compromise

### Response Procedures

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence
3. Notify security team
4. Begin containment procedures

**Investigation**:
1. Analyze logs and events
2. Determine scope of impact
3. Identify root cause
4. Document findings

**Recovery**:
1. Remove threats
2. Restore from clean backups if needed
3. Update security controls
4. Monitor for recurrence

**Post-Incident**:
1. Conduct lessons learned review
2. Update policies and procedures
3. Provide user notifications if required
4. Report to authorities if legally required

# Qwallet Security Policies

This document defines the security policies and requirements for the Qwallet module.

## Authentication Policies

### Identity Verification (sQuid Integration)
- All payment operations MUST verify identity through sQuid
- Subidentity delegation is supported for authorized operations
- Multi-factor authentication required for high-value transactions (>1000 QToken)
- Session tokens expire after 1 hour of inactivity

### Transaction Signing (Qlock Integration)
- All transactions MUST be cryptographically signed
- Signatures use Ed25519 or secp256k1 algorithms
- Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms supported for future-proofing
- Signature verification required before transaction broadcast

## Authorization Policies

### Permission Checks (Qonsent Integration)
- Deny-by-default authorization for all operations
- Explicit permissions required for:
  - Creating payment intents
  - Signing transactions
  - Accessing wallet balances
  - Viewing transaction history
- DAO-based permissions for organizational spending

### Spending Limits
- Daily spending limits enforced per identity
- Monthly spending limits enforced per identity
- DAO-based collective spending limits
- Emergency spending controls for suspicious activity

## Data Protection Policies

### Encryption at Rest
- All wallet private keys encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Payment intent data encrypted before storage
- Transaction metadata encrypted with identity-specific keys
- Database encryption using transparent data encryption (TDE)

### Encryption in Transit
- All API communications use TLS 1.3
- Inter-service communication encrypted using mTLS
- Event bus messages encrypted with per-topic keys
- WebSocket connections secured with WSS

### Key Management
- Private keys stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
- Key rotation performed monthly for production
- Environment-specific key scoping (dev/staging/prod)
- Key derivation using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations

## Privacy Policies

### Data Minimization
- Collect only necessary payment data
- Automatic data purging after retention periods
- Optional transaction anonymization through Qmask
- User control over data sharing preferences

### Transaction Privacy
- Optional privacy profiles for transaction metadata
- Selective data masking for compliance requirements
- Zero-knowledge proofs for balance verification (future)
- Mixing services for enhanced privacy (future)

## Audit and Compliance Policies

### Transaction Logging (Qerberos Integration)
- All payment operations logged immutably
- Risk scoring for suspicious transactions
- Real-time fraud detection and prevention
- Compliance reporting for regulatory requirements

### Audit Trail Requirements
- Complete transaction history maintained
- Cryptographic proof of transaction integrity
- Audit log retention for 7 years minimum
- Regular audit log verification and validation

## Risk Management Policies

### Transaction Risk Assessment
- Real-time risk scoring for all transactions
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Velocity checks for unusual spending patterns
- Geographic risk assessment for cross-border payments

### Fraud Prevention
- Multi-signature requirements for high-value transactions
- Transaction delays for suspicious activities
- Automatic account freezing for confirmed fraud
- Integration with external fraud databases

## Network Security Policies

### Multi-Chain Security
- Network-specific security configurations
- Cross-chain bridge security validations
- Smart contract audit requirements
- Gas price manipulation protection

### Pi Network Integration
- Pi Network-specific security protocols
- KYC verification for Pi transactions
- Pi wallet integration security standards
- Pi Network consensus validation

## Incident Response Policies

### Security Incident Classification
- **Critical**: Unauthorized access to private keys or funds
- **High**: Successful fraud attempts or data breaches
- **Medium**: Failed authentication attempts or suspicious activity
- **Low**: Policy violations or configuration issues

### Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment**: Risk evaluation and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Immediate threat mitigation
4. **Investigation**: Forensic analysis and root cause identification
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and security hardening
6. **Lessons Learned**: Process improvement and policy updates

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Compliance
- **AML/KYC**: Anti-money laundering and know-your-customer compliance
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation compliance
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **SOX**: Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance for financial reporting

### Industry Standards
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management framework
- **OWASP**: Web application security standards
- **CIS Controls**: Critical security controls implementation

## Security Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
- Transaction velocity monitoring
- Failed authentication attempt tracking
- Unusual access pattern detection
- System resource utilization monitoring

### Security Metrics
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Transaction approval/rejection rates
- Security incident frequency and severity
- Compliance audit results and findings

## Security Testing

### Regular Security Assessments
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual security audits
- Continuous vulnerability scanning
- Code security reviews for all releases

### Security Testing Requirements
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Breach Response
1. Immediate system isolation
2. Stakeholder notification
3. Forensic evidence preservation
4. Regulatory reporting (if required)
5. Public disclosure (if required)
6. System recovery and hardening

### Business Continuity
- Hot standby systems for critical operations
- Automated failover procedures
- Data backup and recovery processes
- Communication plans for stakeholders

# Qlock Security Policies

This document defines the security policies and requirements for the Qlock module.

## Key Management Policies

### Key Generation
- All keys MUST be generated using cryptographically secure random number generators
- Key generation MUST occur within HSM/KMS when available
- Keys MUST be environment-specific (dev/staging/prod) with no cross-environment access
- Post-quantum algorithms MUST be supported for future-proofing

### Key Storage
- Private keys MUST NEVER be stored in plaintext
- Keys MUST be encrypted at rest using hardware security modules when available
- Key material MUST be protected with appropriate access controls
- Key metadata MAY be stored separately from key material

### Key Rotation
- Encryption keys MUST be rotated according to schedule:
  - Development: Daily
  - Staging: Weekly  
  - Production: Monthly
- Signing keys MUST be rotated based on usage and risk assessment
- Key rotation MUST be automated with manual override capability
- Old keys MUST be securely destroyed after grace period

### Key Access
- Key access MUST be authenticated and authorized
- All key operations MUST be logged and audited
- Key access MUST follow principle of least privilege
- Emergency key access procedures MUST be documented

## Encryption Policies

### Algorithm Selection
- AES-256-GCM is the default symmetric encryption algorithm
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 is approved for high-performance scenarios
- Post-quantum algorithms (Kyber-768) MUST be available
- Algorithm selection MUST consider performance and security requirements

### Data Classification
- Public data: No encryption required
- Internal data: Standard encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- Sensitive data: High encryption with additional controls
- Critical data: Quantum-resistant encryption with HSM

### Encryption Requirements
- All data MUST be encrypted at rest by default
- Encryption MUST use authenticated encryption modes
- Initialization vectors MUST be unique and unpredictable
- Authentication tags MUST be verified during decryption

## Digital Signature Policies

### Signature Algorithms
- ECDSA-P256 is the default signature algorithm
- RSA-PSS (2048-bit minimum) is approved for compatibility
- Post-quantum signatures (Dilithium-3, Falcon-512) MUST be available
- Hash algorithms MUST be SHA-256 or stronger

### Signature Requirements
- All signatures MUST include timestamp
- Signatures MUST be non-repudiable
- Signature verification MUST check certificate chain when applicable
- Signature metadata MUST be preserved for audit

### Certificate Management
- Digital certificates MUST be issued by trusted CAs
- Certificate validity MUST be checked during verification
- Certificate revocation MUST be supported
- Certificate chains MUST be validated

## Distributed Lock Policies

### Lock Security
- Lock acquisition MUST be authenticated
- Lock ownership MUST be verified before operations
- Lock metadata MUST be protected from tampering
- Lock timeouts MUST be enforced to prevent deadlocks

### Lock Audit
- All lock operations MUST be logged
- Lock ownership changes MUST be audited
- Lock timeout events MUST be recorded
- Lock contention MUST be monitored

## Access Control Policies

### Authentication
- All operations MUST be authenticated using sQuid identity
- Multi-factor authentication SHOULD be used for sensitive operations
- Authentication tokens MUST have limited lifetime
- Failed authentication attempts MUST be logged and monitored

### Authorization
- All operations MUST be authorized using Qonsent policies
- Authorization MUST follow deny-by-default principle
- Permission grants MUST be time-limited when appropriate
- Authorization decisions MUST be logged

### Rate Limiting
- API endpoints MUST implement rate limiting
- Rate limits MUST be identity-based
- Rate limit violations MUST be logged
- Adaptive rate limiting SHOULD be implemented based on behavior

## Audit and Compliance Policies

### Audit Logging
- All cryptographic operations MUST be logged
- Audit logs MUST be immutable and tamper-evident
- Audit logs MUST include sufficient detail for forensics
- Audit logs MUST be retained according to compliance requirements

### Compliance Requirements
- GDPR: Data protection and privacy by design
- SOC2: Security controls and audit trails
- FIPS 140-2: Cryptographic module requirements
- Common Criteria: Security evaluation standards

### Incident Response
- Security incidents MUST be detected and reported
- Incident response procedures MUST be documented
- Key compromise procedures MUST be defined
- Recovery procedures MUST be tested regularly

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Monitoring
- Anomalous cryptographic operations MUST be detected
- Key usage patterns MUST be monitored
- Failed operations MUST be tracked and analyzed
- Performance degradation MUST be monitored

### Alert Thresholds
- Multiple failed authentications within time window
- Unusual key access patterns
- Cryptographic operation failures above threshold
- Lock contention or timeout events

### Response Procedures
- Automated responses for common security events

- Recovery procedures for service restoration

## Development and Testing

### Secure Development
- Code MUST be reviewed for security vulnerabilities
- Dependencies MUST be scanned for known vulnerabilities
- Security testing MUST be integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Threat modeling MUST be performed for new features

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests MUST cover security-critical functions

- Security regression testing MUST be automated

### Environment Security
- Development environments MUST use separate keys
- Test data MUST NOT contain production secrets
- Staging environments MUST mirror production security
- Production access MUST be strictly controlled

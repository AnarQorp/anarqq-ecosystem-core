# QNET Security Policies

This document defines security policies and requirements for the QNET module.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Identity Verification
- All network operations require valid sQuid identity verification
- Node registration requires cryptographic proof of identity
- Administrative operations require elevated permissions via Qonsent

### Access Control
- **Public Operations**: Node discovery, capability queries, basic health checks
- **DAO Operations**: Network topology access, detailed metrics
- **Private Operations**: Node management, configuration changes, administrative functions

### Permission Requirements

#### Node Management
```
qonsent:qnet:node:create - Create new network nodes
qonsent:qnet:node:update - Update node configuration
qonsent:qnet:node:delete - Remove nodes from network
qonsent:qnet:node:admin - Administrative node operations
```

#### Network Operations
```
qonsent:qnet:network:read - Read network topology and status
qonsent:qnet:network:monitor - Access detailed monitoring data
qonsent:qnet:network:configure - Configure network parameters
```

#### Metrics and Analytics
```
qonsent:qnet:metrics:read - Read basic network metrics
qonsent:qnet:metrics:detailed - Access detailed performance metrics
qonsent:qnet:analytics:admin - Administrative analytics access
```

## Encryption and Data Protection

### Data at Rest
- Node configuration encrypted using Qlock
- Metrics data encrypted with environment-specific keys
- Audit logs stored with immutable encryption

### Data in Transit
- All inter-node communication uses TLS 1.3 minimum
- API endpoints require HTTPS in production
- Internal service communication encrypted via service mesh

### Key Management
- Node identity keys managed through KMS/HSM
- Automatic key rotation every 30 days
- Emergency key revocation procedures

## Network Security

### Node Authentication
- Mutual TLS authentication between nodes
- Certificate-based node identity verification
- Regular certificate rotation and validation

### Traffic Protection
- DDoS protection at network edge
- Rate limiting per identity/subidentity/DAO
- Anomaly detection for suspicious patterns

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Integration with Qerberos for threat detection
- Automated incident response procedures

## Audit and Compliance

### Audit Events
All security-relevant events are logged:
- Node join/leave events
- Authentication failures
- Permission denials
- Configuration changes
- Security alerts

### Compliance Requirements
- SOC2 Type II compliance for network operations
- GDPR compliance for any personal data handling
- Industry-standard security practices

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Isolation of affected nodes/regions
4. **Recovery**: Service restoration and validation
5. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

## Rate Limiting and Anti-Abuse

### Rate Limits
- **Anonymous**: 100 requests/hour for public endpoints
- **Authenticated**: 1000 requests/hour for standard operations
- **DAO Members**: 5000 requests/hour for DAO-scoped operations
- **Administrators**: 10000 requests/hour for management operations

### Anti-Abuse Measures
- Progressive penalties for rate limit violations
- Automatic blocking of malicious IP addresses
- Reputation-based access control
- Circuit breakers for service protection

## Security Headers and Middleware

### Required Headers
```
x-squid-id: <identity-id>
x-subid: <subidentity-id> (optional)
x-qonsent: <permission-token>
x-sig: <qlock-signature>
x-ts: <timestamp>
x-api-version: <version>
```

### Security Middleware Stack
1. **Helmet**: Security headers and protection
2. **CORS**: Cross-origin request control
3. **Rate Limiting**: Request throttling
4. **Authentication**: Identity verification
5. **Authorization**: Permission checking
6. **Audit Logging**: Security event recording

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats
1. **Node Impersonation**: Malicious nodes joining network
2. **Traffic Interception**: Man-in-the-middle attacks
3. **DDoS Attacks**: Service availability threats
4. **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized data access
5. **Configuration Tampering**: Unauthorized changes

### Mitigations
1. **Strong Authentication**: Certificate-based node identity
2. **Encryption**: End-to-end traffic protection
3. **Rate Limiting**: Traffic throttling and filtering
4. **Access Control**: Granular permission system
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking

## Security Testing

### Regular Security Assessments
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Monthly vulnerability scans
- Continuous security monitoring
- Annual security architecture review

### Security Metrics
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Permission denial rates
- Security incident frequency
- Mean time to detection/response

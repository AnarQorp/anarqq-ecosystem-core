# Qonsent Security Policies

This document outlines the security policies and requirements for the Qonsent module.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Identity Verification
- All requests must include a valid sQuid identity token in the `Authorization` header
- Identity tokens are verified against the sQuid service
- Expired or invalid tokens result in 401 Unauthorized responses

### Permission Model
- **Deny by Default**: All operations are denied unless explicitly permitted
- **Least Privilege**: Users are granted only the minimum permissions required
- **Time-bound Permissions**: All permissions have expiration times
- **Revocable Permissions**: Permissions can be revoked in real-time

### Standard Headers
All requests must include these headers:
- `x-squid-id`: Primary identity identifier
- `x-subid`: Subidentity identifier (if applicable)
- `x-qonsent`: Consent token for the operation
- `x-sig`: Qlock signature for request integrity
- `x-ts`: Request timestamp
- `x-api-version`: API version being used

## UCAN Policy Engine

### Policy Structure
Policies are defined using UCAN (User Controlled Authorization Networks) format:
- **Issuer**: The identity granting the permission
- **Audience**: The identity receiving the permission
- **Capabilities**: Specific actions that can be performed
- **Caveats**: Conditions and limitations on the capabilities

### Policy Validation
- All policies are validated against JSON Schema
- Policies must be cryptographically signed by the issuer
- Policy chains are validated for delegation authority
- Expired policies are automatically rejected

### Policy Storage
- Policies are stored encrypted at rest using Qlock
- Policy metadata is indexed in Qindex for fast retrieval
- Policy changes are audited through Qerberos

## Access Control

### Resource Identification
Resources are identified using a hierarchical format:
```
<module>:<type>:<identifier>
```
Examples:
- `qdrive:file:abc123`
- `qmarket:listing:xyz789`
- `qmail:message:msg456`

### Permission Types
Standard permission types across the ecosystem:
- `read`: View or retrieve the resource
- `write`: Modify the resource
- `delete`: Remove the resource
- `admin`: Full administrative access
- `share`: Grant permissions to others
- `execute`: Execute or run the resource

### Scope Validation
- Permissions are validated against the requested scope
- Hierarchical permissions are supported (admin includes write, write includes read)
- Context-aware permissions consider time, location, and other factors

## Encryption and Signatures

### Data Encryption
- All sensitive data is encrypted using Qlock before storage
- Encryption keys are managed through the centralized KMS
- Different encryption levels based on data sensitivity

### Request Signing
- All write operations must be signed using Qlock
- Signatures include request payload, timestamp, and nonce
- Replay attacks are prevented through timestamp validation

### Event Integrity
- All published events are signed for integrity verification
- Event signatures can be verified by consumers
- Tampered events are rejected and logged as security incidents

## Audit and Compliance

### Audit Logging
All operations are logged with:
- Identity performing the action
- Resource being accessed
- Action attempted
- Result (allowed/denied)
- Timestamp and context
- Reason for the decision

### Compliance Requirements
- GDPR: Data subject rights are supported
- SOC2: Audit trails are maintained
- HIPAA: Healthcare data handling (if applicable)
- Custom compliance rules can be configured

### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts are monitored
- Unusual permission patterns trigger alerts
- Qerberos integration provides real-time threat detection
- Automated response to security incidents

## Rate Limiting and Anti-Abuse

### Rate Limits
- Per-identity rate limits prevent abuse
- Adaptive limits based on reputation scores
- Burst allowances for legitimate high-volume operations
- Circuit breakers protect against overload

### Anti-Abuse Measures
- Pattern detection for suspicious behavior
- Automatic temporary blocks for repeated violations
- Integration with Qerberos for threat intelligence
- Manual override capabilities for administrators

## Development and Testing

### Security Testing
- Automated security scans in CI/CD pipeline
- Penetration testing for critical paths
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security scanning

### Mock Services
For development and testing:
- Mock sQuid service for identity verification
- Mock Qerberos service for audit logging
- Mock Qlock service for encryption/signing
- Configurable security policies for testing

### Security Configuration
Environment-specific security settings:
- Development: Relaxed policies for testing
- Staging: Production-like security with test data
- Production: Full security enforcement

## Incident Response

### Security Incidents
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Immediate measures to limit damage
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis and evidence collection
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and security improvements
6. **Lessons Learned**: Process improvements and documentation

### Emergency Procedures
- Emergency access procedures for critical situations
- Incident escalation matrix
- Communication protocols for stakeholders
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)

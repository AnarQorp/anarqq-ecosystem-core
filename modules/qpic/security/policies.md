# QpiC Security Policies

This document outlines the security policies and requirements for the QpiC Media Management module.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Identity Verification
- All requests must include valid sQuid identity token
- Token verification performed via sQuid service integration
- Support for subidentity and DAO context

### Permission Requirements

#### Media Upload
- Requires `media:upload` permission
- File size limits enforced per identity/DAO
- Format restrictions based on user permissions

#### Media Access
- Public media: No additional permissions required
- Private media: Requires `media:access` permission for specific resource
- Download permissions checked via Qonsent integration

#### Media Transcoding
- Requires `media:transcode` permission
- Rate limiting applied based on identity reputation
- Resource usage tracking and limits

#### Media Licensing
- Requires `media:license` permission for creating licenses
- Only media owner can create licenses
- License transfers require both parties' consent

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
- All media files encrypted using Qlock before IPFS storage
- Metadata encrypted with separate keys
- Key rotation schedule: monthly for production, weekly for staging

### Encryption in Transit
- All API communications over HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- Internal service communications encrypted
- IPFS content addressed with encrypted CIDs

### Privacy Protection
- Automatic metadata scrubbing for privacy-sensitive fields
- Privacy profile application via Qmask integration
- GDPR compliance with right to erasure

## Access Control

### Deny-by-Default
- All operations require explicit permission
- No implicit access to media files
- Permission inheritance through DAO membership

### Resource-Level Permissions
- Granular permissions per media file
- Time-based access controls
- Geographic restrictions support

### Rate Limiting
- Identity-based rate limiting
- Adaptive limits based on reputation
- Separate limits for different operations:
  - Upload: 10 files/hour for basic users
  - Transcode: 5 jobs/hour for basic users
  - Download: 100 files/hour for basic users

## Content Security

### File Validation
- MIME type validation against allowed formats
- File signature verification
- Maximum file size enforcement (100MB default)

### Virus Scanning
- All uploaded files scanned with ClamAV
- Quarantine system for suspicious files
- Integration with threat intelligence feeds

### Content Sanitization
- SVG files sanitized to remove scripts
- PDF files processed to remove active content
- Office documents converted to safe formats

## Audit and Monitoring

### Audit Logging
- All operations logged via Qerberos integration
- Immutable audit trail in IPFS
- Real-time security event monitoring

### Anomaly Detection
- Unusual upload patterns detection
- Suspicious access pattern monitoring
- Integration with Qerberos risk scoring

### Compliance Monitoring
- GDPR compliance tracking
- Data retention policy enforcement
- Regular security assessments

## Key Management

### Encryption Keys
- Media encryption keys managed via Qlock
- Per-file encryption with unique keys
- Key escrow for regulatory compliance

### Signing Keys
- Event signing keys rotated monthly
- API request signing for critical operations
- Certificate-based authentication for services

## Incident Response

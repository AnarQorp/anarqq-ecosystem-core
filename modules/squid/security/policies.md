# sQuid Security Policies

This document outlines the security policies and requirements for the sQuid identity module.

## Authentication Policies

### Identity Verification
- All identity operations require cryptographic signature verification
- Signatures must be generated using the identity's private key
- Message timestamps must be within 5 minutes of current time to prevent replay attacks
- Device fingerprinting is used for additional security context

### Session Management
- Sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity
- Active sessions are tracked and can be revoked
- Multiple concurrent sessions are allowed but monitored for suspicious activity

## Authorization Policies

### Identity Creation
- Root identity creation is open to all users
- Subidentity creation requires parent identity to be verified (ROOT level)
- Maximum of 10 subidentities per root identity
- Certain subidentity types (AID, ENTERPRISE) require additional verification

### Identity Operations
- Only identity owner can modify identity metadata
- Verification submission requires identity ownership proof
- Reputation updates are restricted to authorized modules only
- Identity deletion requires additional confirmation and affects all subidentities

## Qlock Integration

### Key Management
- All identities have associated cryptographic key pairs
- Private keys are never transmitted or stored on servers
- Public keys are used for signature verification
- Key rotation is supported with proper migration procedures

### Encryption Requirements
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using Qlock
- Inter-service communication uses encrypted channels
- Identity metadata can be encrypted based on privacy settings

## Qonsent Integration

### Permission Management
- Identity operations require appropriate permissions
- Permissions are managed through Qonsent policies
- Deny-by-default approach for all sensitive operations
- Granular permissions for different identity operations

### Privacy Controls
- Users can set privacy levels for their identities
- Data sharing preferences are enforced through Qonsent
- Right to be forgotten is supported with proper data deletion

## Rate Limiting

### Request Limits
- Identity creation: 5 per hour per IP address
- Verification submission: 3 per day per identity
- Reputation queries: 100 per minute per identity
- General API calls: 1000 per hour per identity

### Anti-Abuse Measures
- Suspicious activity detection and automatic blocking
- Progressive delays for repeated violations
- Integration with Qerberos for threat intelligence
- Manual review process for flagged activities

## Audit Requirements

### Logging
- All identity operations are logged with full context
- Logs include timestamps, IP addresses, and user agents
- Sensitive data is masked in logs
- Logs are immutable and stored in IPFS

### Monitoring
- Real-time monitoring of identity operations
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Integration with Qerberos for security alerts
- Performance monitoring and SLA tracking

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Data minimization principles applied
- User consent tracked and managed
- Data retention policies enforced

### KYC/AML
- Identity verification follows KYC requirements
- AML screening for high-risk identities
- Document verification and storage
- Compliance reporting capabilities

## Incident Response

### Security Incidents
- Automated detection and alerting
- Incident classification and escalation
- Forensic data collection and preservation
- Communication procedures for affected users

### Recovery Procedures
- Identity recovery mechanisms for lost access
- Backup and restore procedures
- Disaster recovery planning
- Business continuity measures

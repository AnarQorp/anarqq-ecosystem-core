# Qerberos Security Policies

This document defines the security policies and requirements for the Qerberos security and audit module.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Identity Verification (sQuid Integration)

All requests to Qerberos must include valid identity verification:

```
x-squid-id: <identity-id>
x-subid: <subidentity-id> (optional)
x-sig: <qlock-signature>
x-ts: <timestamp>
```

**Policy**: Deny by default - all operations require explicit identity verification through sQuid.

### Permission Checking (Qonsent Integration)

Qerberos operations require specific permissions:

- `qerberos:audit:read` - Read audit events
- `qerberos:audit:write` - Create audit events
- `qerberos:risk:read` - Read risk scores
- `qerberos:risk:calculate` - Calculate risk scores
- `qerberos:anomaly:detect` - Perform anomaly detection
- `qerberos:alerts:read` - Read security alerts
- `qerberos:alerts:manage` - Manage security alerts
- `qerberos:compliance:read` - Read compliance reports
- `qerberos:compliance:generate` - Generate compliance reports
- `qerberos:admin` - Administrative operations

**Policy**: Least privilege - users receive only the minimum permissions required for their role.

## Data Protection (Qlock Integration)

### Encryption at Rest

All sensitive data stored by Qerberos is encrypted using Qlock:

- **Audit Events**: Encrypted before storage in IPFS
- **Risk Scores**: Encrypted in cache and persistent storage
- **Security Alerts**: Sensitive details encrypted
- **Compliance Reports**: Encrypted with appropriate access controls

**Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM with identity-derived keys

### Encryption in Transit

All communications use end-to-end encryption:

- **API Requests**: TLS 1.3 minimum
- **Event Publishing**: Encrypted event payloads
- **Inter-service Communication**: mTLS with certificate validation

### Cryptographic Signatures

All audit events and security alerts are cryptographically signed:

- **Signature Algorithm**: Ed25519 or RSA-PSS-SHA256
- **Key Management**: Keys managed through Qlock KMS
- **Verification**: All signatures verified on read operations

## Access Control

### Rate Limiting

Qerberos implements multi-layer rate limiting:

- **Identity-based**: 1000 requests/hour per identity
- **Subidentity-based**: 500 requests/hour per subidentity
- **DAO-based**: 10000 requests/hour per DAO
- **Operation-based**: Specific limits for expensive operations:
  - Risk scoring: 100 requests/hour
  - Anomaly detection: 50 requests/hour
  - Compliance reports: 10 requests/hour

### IP-based Restrictions

- **Geo-blocking**: Block requests from high-risk countries
- **Known Bad IPs**: Block requests from known malicious IP addresses
- **Rate Limiting**: Additional IP-based rate limiting for DDoS protection

### Session Management

- **Session Timeout**: 1 hour for regular operations, 15 minutes for admin operations
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Maximum 5 concurrent sessions per identity
- **Session Invalidation**: Automatic invalidation on suspicious activity

## Audit and Monitoring

### Immutable Audit Trail

All operations are logged to an immutable audit trail:

- **Storage**: IPFS with cryptographic integrity verification
- **Retention**: 7 years minimum for compliance
- **Access**: Audit logs are read-only after creation
- **Verification**: Cryptographic proofs of integrity

### Real-time Monitoring

Qerberos monitors itself for security events:

- **Failed Authentication**: Track and alert on authentication failures
- **Permission Violations**: Log and alert on authorization failures
- **Anomalous Patterns**: Detect unusual usage patterns
- **System Health**: Monitor service health and performance

### Alerting

Security alerts are generated for:

- **Critical Events**: Immediate notification for critical security events
- **Threshold Breaches**: Alerts when security thresholds are exceeded
- **Compliance Violations**: Notifications for compliance policy violations
- **System Anomalies**: Alerts for unusual system behavior

## Compliance Requirements

### GDPR Compliance

- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated security purposes
- **Storage Limitation**: Retain data only as long as necessary
- **Data Subject Rights**: Support for access, rectification, erasure requests

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

- **P0 - Critical**: Data breach, system compromise, service outage

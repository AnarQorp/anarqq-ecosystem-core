# Qchat Security Policies

This document defines the security policies and requirements for the Qchat instant messaging module.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Identity Verification (sQuid Integration)
- All users must have verified sQuid identity
- Subidentity support for role-based access
- DAO membership verification for DAO rooms
- Reputation-based access control for REPUTATION rooms

### Permission Checking (Qonsent Integration)
- Deny-by-default authorization model
- Granular permissions per room and action
- Real-time permission revocation support
- UCAN-based policy evaluation

### Required Permissions
```
qchat:room:create - Create new chat rooms
qchat:room:join - Join existing rooms
qchat:room:leave - Leave rooms
qchat:message:send - Send messages
qchat:message:edit - Edit own messages
qchat:message:delete - Delete own messages
qchat:message:react - Add reactions to messages
qchat:room:invite - Invite users to private rooms
qchat:room:moderate - Perform moderation actions
qchat:room:admin - Administrative room management
qchat:room:owner - Full room ownership
```

## Encryption and Data Protection

### Message Encryption (Qlock Integration)
- All messages encrypted end-to-end by default
- Room-specific encryption keys derived from Qlock
- Support for multiple encryption levels:
  - STANDARD: AES-256-GCM
  - HIGH: ChaCha20-Poly1305 with additional key derivation
  - QUANTUM: Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (future)

### Key Management
- Room encryption keys generated per room
- User-specific key derivation from sQuid identity
- Automatic key rotation for long-lived rooms
- Secure key distribution to authorized members
- Key escrow for compliance requirements

### Data at Rest
- All persistent data encrypted using Qlock
- Message content never stored in plaintext
- Metadata minimization for privacy protection
- IPFS storage with encrypted content addressing

## Rate Limiting and Anti-Abuse

### Rate Limits by Identity Type
```
Standard User:
- Messages: 60 per minute, 1000 per hour
- Room creation: 5 per hour, 20 per day
- Room joins: 20 per hour, 100 per day

High Reputation User (>0.8):
- Messages: 120 per minute, 2000 per hour
- Room creation: 10 per hour, 50 per day
- Room joins: 50 per hour, 200 per day

DAO Member:
- Messages: 100 per minute, 1500 per hour
- Room creation: 8 per hour, 30 per day
- Room joins: 30 per hour, 150 per day

Low Reputation User (<0.3):
- Messages: 20 per minute, 200 per hour
- Room creation: 1 per hour, 5 per day
- Room joins: 5 per hour, 20 per day
```

### Anti-Abuse Mechanisms
- Automatic spam detection using content analysis
- Reputation-based message filtering
- Progressive penalties for violations
- Qerberos integration for threat analysis
- Circuit breakers for suspicious activity

## Moderation and Content Control

### Automated Moderation Levels
- **NONE**: No automatic moderation
- **BASIC**: Spam and explicit content filtering
- **STRICT**: Advanced content analysis and filtering
- **AI_ASSISTED**: ML-powered moderation with human review

### Moderation Actions
- **WARN**: Warning message to user
- **MUTE**: Temporary message restriction
- **KICK**: Remove from room (can rejoin)
- **BAN**: Permanent removal from room
- **DELETE_MESSAGE**: Remove specific message
- **PIN_MESSAGE**: Pin important message
- **UNPIN_MESSAGE**: Unpin message

### Reputation Impact
```
Violation Severity -> Reputation Change
LOW: -0.01 to -0.05
MEDIUM: -0.05 to -0.15
HIGH: -0.15 to -0.30
CRITICAL: -0.30 to -0.50
```

## Privacy and Data Protection

### Data Minimization
- Collect only necessary data for functionality
- Automatic data retention policies
- User control over data sharing preferences
- Privacy-preserving analytics

### GDPR Compliance
- Right to access: Export user data
- Right to rectification: Update user information
- Right to erasure: Delete user data and messages
- Right to portability: Data export in standard format
- Right to object: Opt-out of processing

### Data Retention Policies
```
Message Content: 2 years (configurable per room)
User Presence Data: 30 days
Moderation Logs: 7 years
Audit Events: 10 years
Session Data: 24 hours
Temporary Files: 7 days
```

## Security Monitoring and Incident Response

### Qerberos Integration
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Automated threat response
- Security incident escalation
- Compliance reporting

### Monitored Events
- Failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious message patterns
- Unusual room creation activity
- Mass messaging attempts
- Permission escalation attempts
- Data export requests

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Analysis**: Qerberos risk assessment
3. **Containment**: Automatic protective measures
4. **Eradication**: Remove threats and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update policies and procedures

# Task 13.2 Implementation Summary: Real-time WebSocket Dashboard

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive real-time WebSocket dashboard for Qflow that provides live monitoring of system performance, flow executions, validation pipeline status, and alerts. The implementation includes both server-side WebSocket services and a complete web-based dashboard interface.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Real-time Dashboard Service (`RealtimeDashboardService.ts`)

**Core Features:**
- WebSocket server running on configurable port (default: 9090)
- Real-time metrics streaming with configurable intervals
- Client connection management with heartbeat monitoring
- Subscription-based metric streams
- Customizable alerting system with multiple notification channels
- Performance integration with Task 36 metrics

**Key Components:**
- **WebSocket Server**: Handles client connections, subscriptions, and real-time communication
- **Metric Streams**: Configurable streams for performance metrics, flow executions, alerts, etc.
- **Alert Management**: Rule-based alerting with cooldown periods and multiple severity levels
- **Client Management**: Connection tracking, subscription handling, and heartbeat monitoring

**Supported Metric Streams:**
- `performance_metrics`: System performance data (latency, throughput, error rates)
- `scaling_status`: Adaptive scaling events and load distribution
- `ecosystem_correlation`: Cross-module performance correlation
- `alert_events`: Real-time alert notifications
- `flow_executions`: Active flow execution status and progress

### 2. Dashboard Web Interface (`dashboard.html`)

**Features:**
- Real-time system health monitoring
- Performance metrics visualization
- Validation pipeline status
- Active flow execution tracking
- Alert management and display
- Event logging with auto-scroll
- Responsive design with dark theme

**Dashboard Sections:**
- **System Health**: Overall status, connected clients, active streams, uptime
- **Performance Metrics**: Flows/sec, latency, error rates, CPU usage
- **Validation Pipeline**: Success rates, cache hit rates, average duration
- **Active Flows**: Real-time flow execution status
- **Alerts**: Active alerts and notifications
- **Event Log**: Real-time event stream with filtering

### 3. API Integration

**New REST Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/stats` - Dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/data` - Comprehensive dashboard data

- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/alerts` - List alert rules
- `DELETE /api/v1/dashboard/alerts/:id` - Delete alert rules
- `GET /dashboard` - Serve dashboard HTML interface

**WebSocket Protocol:**
- Connection with welcome message and available streams
- Subscription management (`subscribe`, `unsubscribe`)
- Real-time metric updates
- Heartbeat mechanism for connection health
- Error handling and reconnection logic

### 4. Performance Integration

**Task 36 Integration:**
- Integrated with `PerformanceIntegrationService` for metrics collection
- Connected to `AdaptivePerformanceService` for scaling events
- Real-time performance correlation across ecosystem modules
- Automatic performance anomaly detection and alerting

**Adaptive Response Features:**
- Automatic scaling triggers based on performance thresholds
- Load redirection capabilities
- Flow pausing under high load conditions
- Proactive performance optimization

### 5. Service Initialization

**Startup Integration:**
- Services automatically initialized during Qflow startup
- Dashboard WebSocket server starts on port 9090 (configurable)
- Performance services integrated with existing ecosystem
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Technical Architecture

### WebSocket Communication Flow

```
Client Browser ←→ WebSocket (port 9090) ←→ RealtimeDashboardService
                                                    ↓
                                          PerformanceIntegrationService
                                                    ↓
                                          AdaptivePerformanceService
                                                    ↓
                                          Ecosystem Services (Qlock, Qonsent, etc.)
```

### Message Types

**Client → Server:**
- `subscribe`: Subscribe to metric streams
- `unsubscribe`: Unsubscribe from streams
- `set_filters`: Set client-specific filters
- `heartbeat`: Connection health check
- `get_dashboard_data`: Request current dashboard data

**Server → Client:**
- `welcome`: Initial connection with client ID and available streams
- `stream_update`: Real-time metric updates
- `alert_triggered`: Alert notifications
- `heartbeat_ack`: Heartbeat acknowledgment
- `error`: Error messages

### Configuration Options

```typescript
{
  port: 9090,                    // WebSocket server port
  updateInterval: 5000,          // Metric update interval (ms)
  heartbeatInterval: 30000,      // Heartbeat interval (ms)
  maxClients: 100,               // Maximum concurrent clients
  compressionEnabled: true       // WebSocket compression
}
```

## Testing

4. **Real-time Updates**: Metrics update every 5 seconds by default

### Creating Custom Alerts

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/dashboard/alerts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "High CPU Usage",
    "condition": "cpu_utilization > 0.8",
    "severity": "high",
    "channels": ["dashboard", "webhook"],
    "cooldown": 300000
  }'
```

### WebSocket Client Example

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9090');

ws.onopen = () => {
  // Subscribe to performance metrics
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'subscribe',
    data: { streams: ['performance_metrics', 'flow_executions'] }
  }));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Received:', message);
};
```

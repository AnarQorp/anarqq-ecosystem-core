## Series 1: Qflow Fundamentals

### Video 1.1: Introduction to Qflow (20 minutes)

**Target Audience**: Beginners, developers new to Qflow
**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of APIs and automation

#### Script

**[00:00 - 02:00] Opening & Welcome**

*[Screen: Qflow logo and title slide]*

"Welcome to Qflow - the serverless, distributed automation engine for the AnarQ & Q ecosystem. I'm [Instructor Name], and in this video series, we'll explore how Qflow revolutionizes automation by eliminating single points of failure while maintaining enterprise-grade security and performance.

In today's video, we'll cover:
- What Qflow is and why it matters
- How it differs from traditional automation tools
- The Universal Validation Pipeline
- Real-world use cases and benefits

Let's get started!"

**[02:00 - 05:00] Traditional Automation Challenges**

*[Screen: Diagram showing centralized automation architecture with single points of failure]*

"Traditional automation tools like n8n, Zapier, or custom orchestrators all share a common weakness - they rely on centralized servers. This creates several problems:

First, single points of failure. If your automation server goes down, all your workflows stop. This can be catastrophic for business-critical processes.

Second, scalability bottlenecks. As your automation needs grow, you need bigger servers, more resources, and complex load balancing.

Third, security concerns. All your sensitive data and credentials flow through a central point, creating a high-value target for attackers.

And finally, vendor lock-in. Your workflows are tied to specific platforms, making migration difficult and expensive."

*[Screen: Show examples of outages and their business impact]*

**[05:00 - 10:00] Qflow's Serverless Approach**

*[Screen: Diagram showing distributed Qflow architecture]*

"Qflow solves these problems with a fundamentally different approach - serverless, distributed execution.

Instead of running on a central server, Qflow workflows execute across a network of QNET nodes. Each node can independently run workflow steps, and if one node fails, others automatically take over.

This architecture provides several key benefits:

**No Single Point of Failure**: Workflows continue running even if individual nodes go offline.

**Infinite Scalability**: Need more capacity? Simply add more nodes to the network.

**Enhanced Security**: No central server means no central attack vector. Data is encrypted and distributed.

**True Serverless**: You don't manage servers - the network handles everything automatically."

*[Screen: Animation showing workflow execution across multiple nodes]*

**[10:00 - 15:00] Universal Validation Pipeline**

*[Screen: Diagram of the four validation layers]*

"One of Qflow's most powerful features is the Universal Validation Pipeline. Every operation - whether it's a simple HTTP request or a complex data transformation - goes through four validation layers:

**Qlock**: Handles encryption and decryption. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit using enterprise-grade cryptography.

**Qonsent**: Manages permissions and consent. Before any operation executes, Qonsent verifies that the user has the necessary permissions and that any required consents are still valid.

**Qindex**: Provides metadata indexing and searchability. Every workflow, execution, and result is automatically indexed, making it easy to find and analyze your automation data.

**Qerberos**: Ensures security and integrity. This layer detects anomalies, prevents malicious activities, and maintains audit trails for compliance.

This pipeline ensures that every operation in your workflow is secure, compliant, and auditable - automatically."

*[Screen: Show real validation pipeline execution with logs]*

**[15:00 - 18:00] Ecosystem Integration**

*[Screen: Diagram showing Qflow integration with other AnarQ & Q modules]*

"Qflow isn't just a standalone automation tool - it's part of the larger AnarQ & Q ecosystem. This means you get seamless integration with:

**Qmail** for email automation
**Qchat** for messaging and notifications  
**Qdrive** for file operations
**Qwallet** for payment processing
**And many more...**

This ecosystem approach means you can build comprehensive business processes that span multiple services, all with consistent security, monitoring, and governance."

**[18:00 - 20:00] Next Steps**

### Video 1.2: Setting Up Your Environment (25 minutes)

**Target Audience**: Beginners ready to start hands-on work
**Prerequisites**: Video 1.1, basic command line knowledge

#### Script

**[00:00 - 02:00] Welcome & Overview**

*[Screen: Video title and agenda]*

"Welcome back to our Qflow tutorial series! In this video, we'll get your development environment set up and ready for creating workflows.

We'll cover three different installation methods:
- Docker (recommended for beginners)
- npm package installation
- CLI tool setup

By the end of this video, you'll have Qflow running locally and be ready to create your first workflow.

Let's dive in!"

**[02:00 - 08:00] Docker Installation**

*[Screen: Terminal showing Docker commands]*

"The easiest way to get started with Qflow is using Docker. This method handles all dependencies automatically and gives you a consistent environment.

First, make sure you have Docker installed. You can download it from docker.com if you haven't already.

Now, let's pull and run the Qflow container:

```bash
docker run -d --name qflow \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 4001:4001 \
  -e SQUID_IDENTITY=your-squid-identity \
  qflow:latest
```

Let me explain these parameters:
- `-d` runs the container in the background
- `--name qflow` gives our container a friendly name
- `-p 8080:8080` exposes the API port
- `-p 4001:4001` exposes the Libp2p networking port
- The environment variable sets your sQuid identity

After running this command, Qflow will start up and begin connecting to the QNET network."

*[Screen: Show container starting up and logs]*

**[08:00 - 12:00] Health Check & Verification**

*[Screen: Browser showing Qflow web interface]*

"Now let's verify that everything is working correctly. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

You should see the Qflow web interface. This dashboard shows:
- System health status
- Connected QNET nodes
- Recent workflow executions
- Performance metrics

Let's also check the health endpoint directly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

You should see a JSON response indicating that all systems are healthy.

If you see any errors, check the Docker logs:

```bash
docker logs qflow
```

Common issues include port conflicts or network connectivity problems."

**[12:00 - 18:00] CLI Installation & Configuration**

*[Screen: Terminal showing npm installation]*

"For more advanced users, you might prefer installing the Qflow CLI directly. This gives you more control and is better for development workflows.

First, install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @anarq/qflow-cli
```

Now initialize your configuration:

```bash
qflow init --identity your-squid-identity
```

This creates a configuration file in your home directory with your settings. Let's look at what was created:

```bash
cat ~/.qflow/config.yaml
```

You'll see configuration for:
- Your sQuid identity
- QNET node connections
- API endpoints
- Security settings

You can customize these settings based on your needs."

*[Screen: Show configuration file and explain key settings]*

**[18:00 - 22:00] First Commands & Testing**

*[Screen: Terminal showing various qflow commands]*

"Let's test our installation with some basic commands:

Check system health:
```bash
qflow health
```

List available QNET nodes:
```bash
qflow nodes list
```

Check your identity:
```bash
qflow identity whoami
```

View system metrics:
```bash
qflow metrics system
```

These commands help you verify that Qflow is properly connected to the network and ready to execute workflows."

**[22:00 - 25:00] Troubleshooting & Next Steps**

*[Screen: Common error messages and solutions]*

"If you encounter issues, here are the most common problems and solutions:

**Connection refused**: Check that the service is running and ports aren't blocked by a firewall.

**Authentication errors**: Verify your sQuid identity is correctly configured.

**Network timeouts**: Ensure you have internet connectivity and can reach QNET bootstrap nodes.

For more detailed troubleshooting, check our documentation at docs.qflow.anarq.org.

In our next video, we'll create our first workflow - a simple 'Hello World' automation that demonstrates the core concepts of Qflow.

Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time!"

### Video 1.3: Creating Your First Flow (30 minutes)

**Target Audience**: Users with Qflow environment set up
**Prerequisites**: Videos 1.1 and 1.2 completed

#### Script

**[00:00 - 03:00] Welcome & Objectives**

*[Screen: Video title and learning objectives]*

"Welcome back! Now that you have Qflow set up, it's time to create your first workflow. In this video, we'll build a simple but complete automation that demonstrates all the core concepts.

Our workflow will:
- Make an HTTP request to a public API
- Process the response data
- Make decisions based on the data
- Log results and handle errors

By the end of this video, you'll understand:
- Flow definition structure
- Step types and actions
- Data flow between steps
- Error handling patterns
- Execution monitoring

Let's get started!"

**[03:00 - 08:00] Flow Definition Structure**

*[Screen: Code editor showing YAML structure]*

"Every Qflow workflow is defined in YAML or JSON. Let's start with the basic structure:

```yaml
id: "my-first-flow"
name: "My First Qflow Workflow"
version: "1.0.0"
owner: "your-squid-identity"
description: "A simple workflow to demonstrate Qflow basics"

steps:
  # We'll add steps here

metadata:
  tags: ["tutorial", "first-flow"]
  category: "learning"
  visibility: "public"
```

The key sections are:
- **Header information**: ID, name, version, and owner
- **Steps**: The actual workflow logic
- **Metadata**: Tags, categorization, and visibility settings

The `id` must be unique and will be used to reference this flow. The `owner` should be your sQuid identity."

**[08:00 - 15:00] Adding Workflow Steps**

*[Screen: Building the workflow step by step]*

"Now let's add our workflow steps. We'll start with an HTTP request:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: "fetch-data"
    type: "task"
    action: "qflow.action.http"
    params:
      method: "GET"
      url: "https://httpbin.org/json"
      headers:
        Accept: "application/json"
    onSuccess: "process-data"
    onFailure: "handle-error"
```

This step:
- Has a unique ID: `fetch-data`
- Is a `task` type (executes an action)
- Uses the `qflow.action.http` action
- Defines parameters for the HTTP request
- Specifies what to do on success or failure

Next, let's add a data processing step:

```yaml
  - id: "process-data"
    type: "task"
    action: "qflow.action.function"
    params:
      code: |
        const data = input.response.data;
        return {
          hasSlideshow: !!data.slideshow,
          slideCount: data.slideshow ? data.slideshow.slides.length : 0,
          author: data.slideshow ? data.slideshow.author : 'unknown'
        };
    onSuccess: "check-slides"
```

This step uses JavaScript to process the API response and extract relevant information."

**[15:00 - 22:00] Conditional Logic & Error Handling**

*[Screen: Adding conditional steps and error handling]*

"Now let's add conditional logic based on our processed data:

```yaml
  - id: "check-slides"
    type: "condition"
    action: "qflow.condition.if"
    params:
      condition: "${data.slideCount > 0}"
    onTrue: "log-success"
    onFalse: "log-no-slides"

  - id: "log-success"
    type: "task"
    action: "qflow.action.log"
    params:
      message: "Found slideshow by ${data.author} with ${data.slideCount} slides"
      level: "info"
    onSuccess: "complete"

  - id: "log-no-slides"
    type: "task"
    action: "qflow.action.log"
    params:
      message: "No slideshow found in the response"
      level: "warn"
    onSuccess: "complete"
```

And don't forget error handling:

```yaml
  - id: "handle-error"
    type: "task"
    action: "qflow.action.log"
    params:
      message: "HTTP request failed: ${error.message}"
      level: "error"
    onSuccess: "complete"

  - id: "complete"
    type: "task"
    action: "qflow.action.complete"
    params:
      status: "success"
```

The `complete` step marks the end of our workflow."

**[22:00 - 27:00] Creating & Executing the Flow**

*[Screen: Terminal showing flow creation and execution]*

"Now let's create and run our workflow. Save your YAML file as `my-first-flow.yaml`, then:

```bash
# Create the flow
qflow create --file my-first-flow.yaml

# Start execution
qflow start my-first-flow

# This will return an execution ID, let's monitor it
qflow status <execution-id>

# View the logs
qflow logs <execution-id>
```

You should see the workflow execute through each step:
1. HTTP request to httpbin.org
2. Data processing with JavaScript
3. Conditional check for slides
4. Appropriate logging based on the condition
5. Completion

The logs will show you exactly what happened at each step, including any data transformations."

**[27:00 - 30:00] Understanding the Results & Next Steps**

*[Screen: Execution results and web dashboard]*

"Let's examine what happened. In the web dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`, you can see:
- Execution timeline
- Step-by-step results
- Performance metrics
- Any errors or warnings

This gives you complete visibility into your workflow execution.

Key takeaways from this first workflow:
- Flows are defined in YAML with clear structure
- Steps execute sequentially unless you specify parallel execution
- Data flows between steps automatically
- Error handling is explicit and required
- Everything is logged and auditable

In our next video, we'll explore more advanced features like:
- Parallel execution
- Complex data transformations
- Integration with ecosystem services
- Webhook triggers

Thanks for following along, and I'll see you in the next video!"

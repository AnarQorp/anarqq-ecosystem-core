## General Questions

### What is Qflow?

Qflow is a serverless, distributed automation engine that serves as the universal coherence motor for the AnarQ & Q ecosystem. Unlike traditional automation tools that rely on centralized servers, Qflow executes workflows across a distributed network of QNET nodes, eliminating single points of failure while maintaining enterprise-grade security and performance.

### How is Qflow different from n8n, Zapier, or other automation tools?

**Key Differences:**

1. **Serverless Architecture**: No central server to manage or that can fail
2. **Distributed Execution**: Workflows run across multiple nodes automatically
3. **Universal Validation Pipeline**: Every operation goes through Qlock → Qonsent → Qindex → Qerberos validation
4. **Ecosystem Integration**: Native integration with all AnarQ & Q modules
5. **DAO Governance**: Multi-tenant governance with DAO-based subnets
6. **True Decentralization**: No vendor lock-in or central control

### What are the main benefits of using Qflow?

- **High Availability**: No single point of failure
- **Infinite Scalability**: Add nodes to increase capacity
- **Enhanced Security**: Distributed architecture with end-to-end encryption
- **Compliance Ready**: Built-in audit trails and governance
- **Cost Effective**: Pay only for what you use
- **Future Proof**: Open architecture prevents vendor lock-in

### Is Qflow open source?

Qflow is part of the AnarQ & Q ecosystem, which follows an open-source philosophy. The core engine and protocols are open source, while some enterprise features may require licensing.

## Flow Development

### What types of steps can I use in workflows?

**Step Types:**
- **Task**: Execute specific actions (HTTP requests, functions, etc.)
- **Condition**: Make decisions based on data
- **Parallel**: Execute multiple steps simultaneously
- **Event Trigger**: Respond to external events

**Common Actions:**
- `qflow.action.http` - HTTP requests
- `qflow.action.function` - Custom JavaScript
- `qflow.action.transform` - Data transformation
- `qflow.module.*` - Ecosystem module integration

### How do I handle errors in workflows?

Every step should specify `onSuccess` and `onFailure` paths:

```yaml
- id: "api-call"
  type: "task"
  action: "qflow.action.http"
  params:
    url: "https://api.example.com/data"
  onSuccess: "process-data"
  onFailure: "handle-error"
  retryPolicy:
    maxAttempts: 3
    backoffMs: 1000
```

### Can I use custom JavaScript code in workflows?

Yes! Use the `qflow.action.function` action:

```yaml
- id: "custom-logic"
  type: "task"
  action: "qflow.action.function"
  params:
    code: |
      const processedData = input.data.map(item => ({
        ...item,
        processed: true,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      }));
      return { processedData };
```

All custom code runs in secure WASM sandboxes with resource limits.

### How do I pass data between steps?

Data flows automatically through the execution context:

```yaml
- id: "step1"
  type: "task"
  action: "qflow.action.http"
  params:
    url: "https://api.example.com/users"
  # Response data becomes available to next steps

- id: "step2"
  type: "task"
  action: "qflow.action.log"
  params:
    message: "Found ${data.response.data.length} users"
```

Use expressions like `${data.fieldName}` to access previous step results.

### Can I run steps in parallel?

Yes! Use the `parallel` step type:

```yaml
- id: "parallel-tasks"
  type: "parallel"
  steps:
    - id: "task1"
      action: "qflow.action.http"
      params:
        url: "https://api1.example.com"
    - id: "task2"
      action: "qflow.action.http"
      params:
        url: "https://api2.example.com"
  onComplete: "merge-results"
```

### How do I schedule workflows?

Use the schedule trigger:

```yaml
- id: "scheduled-start"
  type: "event-trigger"
  action: "qflow.trigger.schedule"
  params:
    cron: "0 9 * * MON-FRI"  # 9 AM weekdays
    timezone: "UTC"
  onEvent: "start-workflow"
```

## Security & Authentication

### How does authentication work in Qflow?

Qflow uses sQuid identities for authentication:

1. **Identity Creation**: Create a sQuid identity
2. **Authentication**: Login with your identity
3. **Authorization**: Permissions managed through Qonsent
4. **Flow Ownership**: Flows are owned by identities

```bash
qflow auth login --identity your-squid-identity
qflow auth status
```

### How are credentials managed?

Credentials are stored securely and accessed via the `${secrets.name}` syntax:

```bash
# Store credentials
qflow credentials set api-key --value your-api-key

# Use in flows
params:
  apiKey: "${secrets.api-key}"
```

### Is my data encrypted?

Yes! Qflow provides end-to-end encryption:
- **Data at rest**: Encrypted in IPFS storage
- **Data in transit**: Encrypted between nodes
- **Execution context**: Encrypted during processing
- **Credentials**: Always encrypted and never logged

### What is the Universal Validation Pipeline?

Every operation goes through four validation layers:
1. **Qlock**: Encryption/decryption validation
2. **Qonsent**: Permission and consent verification
3. **Qindex**: Metadata indexing and searchability
4. **Qerberos**: Security and integrity checks

This ensures all operations are secure, compliant, and auditable.

## Performance & Scaling

### How does Qflow scale?

Qflow scales horizontally by adding more QNET nodes:
- **Automatic Load Distribution**: Workflows distributed across available nodes
- **Node Selection**: Intelligent selection based on latency, load, and performance
- **Elastic Scaling**: Nodes can join/leave the network dynamically
- **No Central Bottleneck**: No single server to overwhelm

### What are the performance characteristics?

**Typical Performance:**
- Flow start latency: < 100ms
- Step execution: < 1s for basic operations
- Validation pipeline: < 50ms per layer
- Node selection: < 10ms

Performance varies based on network conditions and workflow complexity.

### How do I optimize workflow performance?

**Best Practices:**
1. **Use parallel execution** for independent steps
2. **Enable caching** for repeated operations
3. **Optimize resource limits** for steps
4. **Minimize data transfer** between steps
5. **Use appropriate timeouts**

```yaml
# Example optimization
- id: "optimized-step"
  type: "task"
  action: "qflow.action.http"
  params:
    url: "https://api.example.com/data"
    cache:
      enabled: true
      ttlSeconds: 300
  resourceLimits:
    memoryMB: 64
    cpuTimeMs: 5000
```

### Can I monitor performance?

Yes! Qflow provides comprehensive monitoring:
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time metrics at `http://localhost:8080/dashboard`
- **CLI Commands**: `qflow metrics system`, `qflow metrics flows`
- **API Endpoints**: `/metrics` for Prometheus integration
- **Alerting**: Configurable alerts for performance issues

## Troubleshooting

### My workflow won't start. What should I check?

**Common Issues:**
1. **Authentication**: `qflow auth status`
2. **Flow validation**: `qflow validate my-flow.yaml`
3. **Node connectivity**: `qflow nodes list`
4. **Permissions**: `qflow permissions check my-flow`
5. **Resource availability**: `qflow metrics system`

### How do I debug workflow execution?

**Debugging Tools:**
```bash
# Enable debug logging
qflow config set logging.level debug

# View detailed logs
qflow logs <execution-id> --level debug

# Trace execution
qflow trace <execution-id>

# Step through execution
qflow start my-flow --debug --pause-at step-id
```

### My workflow is running slowly. How can I improve performance?

**Performance Troubleshooting:**
1. **Check node performance**: `qflow network node-stats`
2. **Enable caching**: Add cache configuration to steps
3. **Use parallel execution**: Convert sequential to parallel where possible
4. **Optimize resource limits**: Adjust memory and CPU limits
5. **Check network latency**: `qflow network ping <node-id>`

### I'm getting validation errors. What do they mean?

**Common Validation Errors:**
- **Qlock errors**: Encryption/decryption issues - check credentials
- **Qonsent errors**: Permission denied - verify user permissions
- **Qindex errors**: Metadata issues - check flow definition
- **Qerberos errors**: Security violations - review step parameters

Use `qflow validation test --layer <layer-name>` to test specific layers.

### How do I recover from failed executions?

**Recovery Options:**
1. **Resume execution**: `qflow resume <execution-id>`
2. **Restart from checkpoint**: `qflow restart <execution-id> --from-checkpoint <checkpoint-id>`
3. **Rollback changes**: `qflow rollback <execution-id>`
4. **Manual intervention**: Fix issues and restart

# Qflow - Serverless Automation Engine

Qflow is the serverless, distributed automation engine that serves as the universal coherence motor for the entire AnarQ & Q ecosystem. It replaces centralized orchestrators like n8n with a decentralized, multi-tenant execution environment running entirely on QNET nodes.

## Overview

Qflow operates on a peer-to-peer architecture using:
- **QNET nodes** for distributed execution
- **Libp2p Pubsub** for coordination
- **IPFS** for distributed state storage
- **WebAssembly (WASM)** sandboxes for secure execution
- **Universal Validation Pipeline** (Qlock â†’ Qonsent â†’ Qindex â†’ Qerberos) for ecosystem integrity

## Event Schemas

Qflow uses a comprehensive event-driven architecture with versioned schemas for all operations:

### Core Event Types

- **q.qflow.flow.created.v1** - Emitted when a new flow definition is created
- **q.qflow.exec.started.v1** - Emitted when a flow execution begins
- **q.qflow.exec.step.dispatched.v1** - Emitted when a step is dispatched to a QNET node
- **q.qflow.exec.step.completed.v1** - Emitted when a step execution completes
- **q.qflow.exec.completed.v1** - Emitted when a flow execution finishes
- **q.qflow.validation.pipeline.executed.v1** - Emitted when the universal validation pipeline runs
- **q.qflow.external.event.received.v1** - Emitted when external events (webhooks) are received

### Schema Registry

The `SchemaRegistry` class provides:
- **Schema Loading**: Automatic loading of all event schemas
- **Validation**: Strict validation of events against their schemas
- **Versioning**: Support for schema evolution and backward compatibility
- **Event Creation**: Helper methods to create properly structured events

```typescript
import { schemaRegistry } from './src/schemas/SchemaRegistry.js';

// Create a validated event
const event = schemaRegistry.createEvent(
  'q.qflow.flow.created.v1',
  'squid:user123',
  {
    flowId: 'flow-123',
    flowName: 'My Automation Flow',
    flowVersion: '1.0.0',
    owner: 'squid:user123',
    ipfsCid: 'QmFlowDefinition123'
  }
);

// Validate an existing event
const validation = schemaRegistry.validateEvent('q.qflow.flow.created.v1', event);
if (!validation.valid) {
  console.error('Validation errors:', validation.errors);
}
```

### Event Emitter

The `QflowEventEmitter` integrates with the ecosystem's EventBusService:

```typescript
import { qflowEventEmitter } from './src/events/EventEmitter.js';

// Emit a flow created event
await qflowEventEmitter.emitFlowCreated('squid:user123', {
  flowId: 'flow-123',
  flowName: 'My Flow',
  flowVersion: '1.0.0',
  owner: 'squid:user123',
  ipfsCid: 'QmFlowDef123'
});

// Subscribe to events
await qflowEventEmitter.subscribe('q.qflow.exec.started.v1', async (event) => {
  console.log('Execution started:', event.data.executionId);
});
```

## Architecture Principles

### 1. No Central Server
- All operations run on distributed QNET nodes
- No single point of failure or control
- Peer-to-peer coordination via Libp2p

### 2. Universal Validation Pipeline
- Every operation validated through Qlock â†’ Qonsent â†’ Qindex â†’ Qerberos
- Ensures ecosystem-wide integrity and compliance
- Decoupled component reusable by other modules

### 3. Multi-Tenant DAO Governance
- DAO-based subnets for complete execution isolation
- DAO-specific policies and node approval
- Scalable governance without central authority

### 4. Serverless Sandbox Execution
- WebAssembly (WASM) sandboxes for secure code execution
- Resource limits and security isolation
- DAO-approved code templates only

### 5. Auditable Distributed State
- All state stored in IPFS with cryptographic signatures
- Complete audit trails for compliance
- Resumable execution after interruptions

  async () => loadHeavyComponent(),
  {
    type: 'module',
    size: 5 * 1024 * 1024, // 5MB
    dependencies: ['dependency-1', 'dependency-2'],
    priority: 8
  }
);

// Automatic dependency resolution
const component = await lazyManager.loadComponent('heavy-component');
```

**Cache Management:**

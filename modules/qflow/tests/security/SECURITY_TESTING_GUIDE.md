# Qflow Security Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information about the security testing framework for Qflow, including how to run tests, interpret results, and contribute to the security testing suite.

## Overview

The Qflow security testing suite is designed to validate the security posture of the serverless automation engine through comprehensive testing across multiple security domains:

- **Sandbox Escape Testing**: Validates WASM sandbox isolation and security
- **Permission Bypass Testing**: Tests authentication and authorization controls
- **Data Leakage Testing**: Ensures proper data isolation and protection
- **Cryptographic Security Testing**: Validates encryption, signatures, and key management
- **Network Security Testing**: Tests network communication security and attack prevention
- **Penetration Testing**: Advanced security testing with real attack simulations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- TypeScript 5+
- Docker (for isolated testing environments)
- Sufficient system permissions for security testing

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to security tests directory
cd modules/qflow/tests/security

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Prepare reports directory
npm run prepare-reports
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all security tests
npm run test:security

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:security:sandbox      # Sandbox escape tests
npm run test:security:permissions  # Permission bypass tests
npm run test:security:isolation    # Data leakage tests
npm run test:security:crypto       # Cryptographic security tests
npm run test:security:network      # Network security tests

## Test Results and Reporting

### Understanding Test Results

Test results are categorized by status:
- **PASS**: Security control is working properly
- **FAIL**: Security vulnerability detected
- **SKIP**: Test was skipped (usually due to environment constraints)

### Risk Levels

- **LOW**: Minor security issues that don't pose immediate risk
- **MEDIUM**: Moderate security issues that should be addressed
- **HIGH**: Serious security issues requiring prompt attention
- **CRITICAL**: Severe security vulnerabilities requiring immediate action

### Report Formats

The security testing suite generates multiple report formats:

1. **Console Output**: Real-time test results and summary
2. **JSON Report**: Machine-readable detailed results
3. **HTML Report**: Human-readable comprehensive report with visualizations
4. **CSV Report**: Vulnerability data for analysis and tracking

Reports are saved in `modules/qflow/reports/security/` with timestamps.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Test environment configuration
NODE_ENV=test
QFLOW_VERSION=0.1.0

# Security test specific
SECURITY_TEST_MODE=true
SECURITY_TEST_TIMEOUT=300000
SECURITY_REPORTS_DIR=./reports/security

# Mock service configuration
MOCK_SQUID_SERVICE=true
MOCK_QLOCK_SERVICE=true
MOCK_QONSENT_SERVICE=true
MOCK_QINDEX_SERVICE=true
MOCK_QERBEROS_SERVICE=true
```

### Test Configuration

Security tests can be configured via `vitest.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    testTimeout: 300000, // 5 minutes for security tests
    hookTimeout: 60000,  // 1 minute for setup/teardown
    sequence: {
      concurrent: false // Security tests run sequentially
    },
    isolate: true,
    maxConcurrency: 1
  }
});
```

## Contributing to Security Tests

### Adding New Security Tests

1. **Identify Security Domain**: Determine which category your test belongs to
2. **Create Test Method**: Add test method to appropriate test class
3. **Follow Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names starting with `test`
4. **Use Expected Failure Pattern**: Most security tests should expect to fail (security working)
5. **Add Documentation**: Document what the test validates and expected behavior

### Example Security Test

```typescript
private async testNewSecurityFeature(): Promise<TestResult> {
  return await this.testRunner.executeTest(
    'New Security Feature Test',
    async () => {
      // Attempt to exploit security feature
      const maliciousPayload = this.createMaliciousPayload();
      
      // This should fail - security control should prevent exploitation
      await this.attemptExploitation(maliciousPayload);
    },
    true // Expected to fail (security control working)
  );
}
```

### Test Guidelines

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be completely isolated
2. **Cleanup**: Always clean up test artifacts
3. **Documentation**: Document test purpose and expected behavior
4. **Error Handling**: Properly handle and report errors
5. **Performance**: Consider test execution time
6. **Reproducibility**: Tests should be deterministic and reproducible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Timeouts
```bash
# Increase timeout for complex security tests
export SECURITY_TEST_TIMEOUT=600000
```

#### Permission Errors
```bash
# Ensure proper permissions for security testing
sudo npm run test:security
```

#### Docker Issues
```bash
# Ensure Docker is running for isolated testing
docker --version
sudo systemctl start docker
```

#### Report Generation Failures
```bash
# Ensure reports directory exists and is writable
mkdir -p modules/qflow/reports/security
chmod 755 modules/qflow/reports/security
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed test execution information:

```bash
DEBUG=qflow:security npm run test:security
```

### Verbose Output

Get detailed test output:

```bash
npm run test:security -- --reporter=verbose
```

## Security Test Automation

### CI/CD Integration

Add security tests to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test:security
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: security-reports
          path: modules/qflow/reports/security/
```

### Scheduled Security Testing

Run security tests on a schedule:

```bash
# Add to crontab for daily security testing
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/qflow && npm run test:security
```

## Security Test Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of security controls tested
- **Vulnerability Detection Rate**: Number of vulnerabilities found per test run
- **False Positive Rate**: Percentage of false security alerts
- **Test Execution Time**: Time required to complete security test suite
- **Risk Level Trend**: Changes in overall security risk level over time

### Monitoring and Alerting

Set up monitoring for security test results:

```bash
# Example alert script
if [ "$SECURITY_RISK_LEVEL" = "CRITICAL" ]; then
  echo "CRITICAL security vulnerabilities detected!" | mail -s "Security Alert" security@company.com
fi
```

## Best Practices

### Security Testing Best Practices

1. **Regular Testing**: Run security tests regularly, not just before releases
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all security domains and attack vectors
3. **Real-world Scenarios**: Use realistic attack scenarios and payloads
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update tests based on new threats
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of security controls and tests
6. **Incident Response**: Have procedures for handling security test failures
7. **Compliance**: Ensure tests meet regulatory and compliance requirements

### Development Integration

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run critical security tests before code commits
2. **Pull Request Validation**: Require security test passes for PR approval
3. **Security Reviews**: Include security test results in code reviews
4. **Threat Modeling**: Use security tests to validate threat model assumptions

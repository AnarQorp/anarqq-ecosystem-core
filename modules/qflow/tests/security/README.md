# Qflow Security and Penetration Testing Suite

This directory contains comprehensive security and penetration tests for the Qflow serverless automation engine.

## Test Categories

### 1. Sandbox Escape Testing
- WASM sandbox isolation validation
- Resource limit bypass attempts
- Host system access prevention
- Network access restriction testing

### 2. Permission Bypass Testing
- sQuid identity authentication bypass attempts
- Qonsent permission validation bypass
- DAO governance policy circumvention
- Multi-tenant isolation breach attempts

### 3. Data Leakage and Isolation Testing
- Cross-tenant data access prevention
- DAO subnet isolation validation
- Execution context isolation
- State storage encryption validation

### 4. Cryptographic Security Testing
- Qlock encryption/decryption integrity
- Signature validation bypass attempts
- Key management security
- Man-in-the-middle attack prevention

### 5. Network Security Testing
- Libp2p communication security
- Message tampering detection
- Byzantine node behavior handling
- Network partition attack resilience

## Running Security Tests

```bash
# Run all security tests
npm run test:security

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:security:sandbox
npm run test:security:permissions
npm run test:security:isolation
npm run test:security:crypto
npm run test:security:network

# Run penetration tests (requires elevated permissions)
npm run test:pentest
```

## Test Environment Requirements

- Isolated test environment with multiple QNET nodes
- Mock ecosystem services (sQuid, Qlock, Qonsent, Qindex, Qerberos)
- Docker containers for sandbox testing
- Network simulation tools for partition testing

## Security Test Results

All security tests must pass before deployment to production. Any failures indicate potential security vulnerabilities that must be addressed.

## Compliance

These tests help ensure compliance with:
- GDPR data protection requirements
- SOC2 security controls
- Industry best practices for distributed systems security

# Qmarket Security Policies

This document outlines the security policies and requirements for the Qmarket module, including integration with Qlock, Qonsent, and other security modules.

## Authentication and Authorization

### sQuid Identity Verification
- All marketplace operations require valid sQuid identity verification
- Subidentity support for DAO-based listings and purchases
- Identity headers must be present and validated for all authenticated endpoints

### Qonsent Permission Policies
- **Deny-by-default**: All operations require explicit permission grants
- **Granular permissions**: Separate permissions for create, read, update, delete operations
- **Resource-level access**: Permissions tied to specific listings and purchases
- **Time-based access**: Support for temporary and expiring permissions

### Permission Matrix

| Operation | Required Permission | Additional Checks |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Create Listing | `qmarket:create` | Identity verification |
| View Public Listing | None | Public visibility only |
| View Private Listing | `qmarket:read` + resource access | Owner or granted access |
| Update Listing | `qmarket:update` + resource ownership | Owner only |
| Delete Listing | `qmarket:delete` + resource ownership | Owner only |
| Purchase Listing | `qmarket:purchase` | Valid payment method |
| Access Purchased Content | Purchase license | Valid license |

## Data Encryption and Protection

### Qlock Integration
- **Sensitive data encryption**: All sensitive listing data encrypted at rest
- **Digital signatures**: All transactions signed with Qlock
- **Key management**: Environment-specific key scoping
- **Encryption levels**: Support for basic, advanced, and quantum-ready encryption

### Encrypted Data Types
- Seller contact information
- Private notes and internal metadata
- Payment details and transaction history
- License terms and restrictions
- User analytics and behavior data

### Signature Requirements
- Listing creation signatures
- Purchase transaction signatures
- License transfer signatures
- Administrative action signatures

## Privacy and Anonymization

### Qmask Integration
- **Privacy profiles**: Automatic application of privacy profiles based on content type
- **Data anonymization**: PII removal from public listings
- **Consent tracking**: GDPR-compliant consent management
- **Right to erasure**: Support for data deletion requests

### Privacy Levels
- **Public**: Minimal privacy protection, full discoverability
- **DAO-only**: Limited to DAO members, enhanced privacy
- **Private**: Maximum privacy protection, owner-only access

## Audit and Monitoring

### Qerberos Integration
- **Comprehensive audit logging**: All operations logged immutably
- **Security event monitoring**: Real-time threat detection
- **Anomaly detection**: ML-based pattern recognition
- **Compliance reporting**: Automated regulatory compliance

### Audit Event Types
- Listing lifecycle events (create, update, delete)
- Purchase and payment events
- License management events
- Access and permission changes
- Security violations and anomalies

## Rate Limiting and Anti-Abuse

### Multi-layer Rate Limiting
- **Identity-based limits**: Per sQuid identity rate limits
- **Subidentity limits**: Separate limits for subidentities
- **DAO-based limits**: Collective limits for DAO operations
- **Operation-specific limits**: Different limits for different operations

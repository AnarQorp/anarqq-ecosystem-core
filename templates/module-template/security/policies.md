# Security Policies - {{MODULE_NAME}}

This document defines the security policies and requirements for the {{MODULE_NAME}} module.

## Security by Default

The {{MODULE_NAME}} module implements security by default with the following principles:

- **Deny by Default**: All operations require explicit permission
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions granted
- **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust between modules
- **Encryption Everywhere**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit

## Authentication and Authorization

### Identity Verification (sQuid Integration)

All requests must include valid identity headers:

```
x-squid-id: <uuid>          # Required: sQuid identity identifier
x-subid: <uuid>             # Optional: Subidentity identifier
x-sig: <signature>          # Optional: Qlock signature for sensitive operations
x-ts: <timestamp>           # Optional: Request timestamp
```

**Policy**: Every request MUST be validated against sQuid for identity verification.

**Implementation**: See `middleware.js` for authentication middleware.

### Permission Checking (Qonsent Integration)

Sensitive operations require permission validation:

```
x-qonsent: <permission-token>  # Qonsent permission token
```

**Policy**: All write operations and sensitive read operations MUST check permissions via Qonsent.

**Scopes**:
- `{{MODULE_NAME}}:read` - Read access to resources
- `{{MODULE_NAME}}:write` - Write access to resources
- `{{MODULE_NAME}}:admin` - Administrative access
- `{{MODULE_NAME}}:delete` - Delete access to resources

### Rate Limiting

**Policy**: Implement multi-layer rate limiting to prevent abuse.

**Limits**:
- **Per Identity**: 1000 requests/hour
- **Per Subidentity**: 500 requests/hour
- **Per DAO**: 5000 requests/hour (shared among members)
- **Anonymous**: 100 requests/hour

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Rate limiting configuration
const rateLimits = {
  identity: { windowMs: 3600000, max: 1000 },
  subidentity: { windowMs: 3600000, max: 500 },
  dao: { windowMs: 3600000, max: 5000 },
  anonymous: { windowMs: 3600000, max: 100 }
};
```

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest (Qlock Integration)

**Policy**: All sensitive data MUST be encrypted at rest using Qlock.

**Data Classification**:
- **Public**: No encryption required
- **Internal**: Encrypt with module key
- **Confidential**: Encrypt with user-specific key
- **Restricted**: Encrypt with HSM-backed key

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Encrypt sensitive data before storage
const encryptedData = await qlock.encrypt(data, {
  algorithm: 'AES-256-GCM',
  keyId: userKeyId,
  context: { module: '{{MODULE_NAME}}', operation: 'store' }
});
```

### Encryption in Transit

**Policy**: All communication MUST use TLS 1.3 or higher.

**Requirements**:
- HTTPS for all HTTP endpoints
- WSS for WebSocket connections
- mTLS for service-to-service communication
- Certificate pinning for critical connections

### Data Anonymization (Qmask Integration)

**Policy**: Personal data MUST be anonymized using Qmask profiles when appropriate.

**Profiles**:
- `public`: Remove all PII
- `analytics`: Pseudonymize identifiers
- `audit`: Preserve audit trail while anonymizing
- `gdpr`: Full anonymization for GDPR compliance

## Audit and Monitoring (Qerberos Integration)

### Audit Logging

**Policy**: All security-relevant events MUST be logged to Qerberos.

**Events to Log**:
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization decisions (allow/deny)
- Data access (read/write/delete)
- Configuration changes
- Security violations
- Error conditions

**Log Format**:
```javascript
const auditEvent = {
  type: 'SECURITY_EVENT',
  ref: resourceId,
  actor: { squidId, subId },
  layer: '{{MODULE_NAME}}',
  verdict: 'ALLOW|DENY|WARN',
  details: {
    operation: 'read|write|delete',
    resource: resourceType,
    reason: 'permission_granted|rate_limited|etc'
  }
};
```

### Anomaly Detection

**Policy**: Integrate with Qerberos for real-time anomaly detection.

**Monitored Patterns**:
- Unusual access patterns
- High-frequency requests
- Failed authentication attempts
- Permission escalation attempts
- Data exfiltration patterns

### Security Metrics

**Policy**: Monitor security metrics and alert on violations.

**Metrics**:
- Authentication failure rate
- Authorization denial rate
- Rate limiting violations
- Encryption failures
- Audit log failures

**Alerts**:
- Authentication failure rate > 5%
- Authorization denial rate > 10%
- Rate limiting violations > 100/hour
- Any encryption failures
- Audit log delivery failures

## Key Management

# Qsocial Integration Spec – AnarQ&Q Ecosystem

Qsocial is the social dashboard and Reddit-style interface for the AnarQ&Q ecosystem. It enables post creation, voting, group formation, and visual aggregation of content across modules like Qdrive, QpiC, and Qmarket.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Modular Architecture (Q∞)
- The module must follow the modular entry-process-output logic.
- Storage layer must integrate with Qlock (encryption), QNET (network dispatch), and Qindex (indexing of metadata).

### 2. Identity Binding (sQuid)
- All uploads and actions must be signed or attributed to a `sQuid` identity.
- Sub-identities, reputation levels, and KYC-bound actions must be supported.

### 3. Privacy & Permissions (Qonsent)
- All file uploads must generate and link to a privacy profile (`qonsent_out`) defining:
  - Who can access (public, DAO-only, private).
  - What type of data is stored (metadata classification).

### 4. Traceability (Qindex)
- Each file uploaded must be assigned:
  - a CID (via IPFS),
  - metadata including sQuid ID, timestamp, visibility profile,
  - stored in a decentralized index for lookup and audit.

### 5. Security & Monitoring (Qerberos)
- Future support for active monitoring of spam, loops, or suspicious behavior is required.
- Ideally, uploads and interactions are registered in Qerberos logs or support event hooks.

## Additional Notes

- CID must be generated using onlyHash=true for IPFS traceability.
- Filecoin compatibility must include metadata for deal prep (sector class, size, type).
- Frontend should display upload status, CID, and privacy/visibility info.

This spec reflects the expectations of the AnarQ&Q framework and should be used as a reference for validation and review.

# Qflow Serverless Automation Engine - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Qflow is the serverless, distributed automation engine that serves as the universal coherence motor for the entire AnarQ & Q ecosystem. It replaces centralized orchestrators like n8n with a decentralized, multi-tenant execution environment running entirely on QNET nodes, ensuring no single point of control while maintaining layer-by-layer coherence across all ecosystem operations. Qflow functions as the distributed automation backbone that enables dynamic, DAO-validated workflows, external event processing, and cross-module coordination without any central server, relying on peer-to-peer coordination, on-chain governance, and the universal validation pipeline (Qlock → Qonsent → Qindex → Qerberos) that ensures ecosystem-wide integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Serverless Distributed Architecture

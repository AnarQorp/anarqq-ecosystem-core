# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the registration and activation of the Qwallet module in the AnarQ & Q ecosystem through the Qindex service. The registration process involves generating official metadata, signing it with the ROOT identity using Qlock, uploading it to Qindex, and verifying its production-ready status. This ensures proper module authentication, compliance tracking, and ecosystem integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a ROOT identity administrator, I want to register the Qwallet module in Qindex with proper metadata and signatures, so that it becomes officially recognized and discoverable within the ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ROOT identity initiates module registration THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive QModuleMetadata containing module name, version, description, supported identities, integrations, status, audit hash, repository URL, documentation CID, and compliance information
2. WHEN metadata is generated THEN the system SHALL include all required fields: module name, version, description, identities_supported array, integrations array, status, audit_hash, repository URL, documentation CID, compliance object, activated_by field, and timestamp
3. WHEN metadata includes compliance information THEN the system SHALL specify audit status, risk_scoring capability, privacy_enforced flag, and kyc_support availability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a ROOT identity administrator, I want the module metadata to be cryptographically signed using Qlock, so that the registration can be verified and trusted by other ecosystem components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN module metadata is complete THEN the system SHALL use IdentityQlockService to sign the metadata with ROOT identity credentials
2. WHEN signing is performed THEN the system SHALL attach a Qlock-compliant signature, the ROOT identity's public key, and signature type identifier
3. WHEN signature is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure the signed metadata can be verified by other ecosystem services

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a ROOT identity administrator, I want the signed module metadata to be registered in Qindex, so that it becomes searchable and accessible to other ecosystem components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signed metadata is ready THEN the system SHALL call QindexService.registerModule with module name and signed metadata
2. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success status, IPFS CID, index identifier, and timestamp
3. WHEN registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and allow retry mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a ROOT identity administrator, I want to verify that the module registration was successful and the module is production-ready, so that I can confirm the ecosystem integration is complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN module registration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a verification method to check module status
2. WHEN verification is performed THEN the system SHALL confirm the module status is "production_ready"
3. WHEN verification includes audit checks THEN the system SHALL validate log entries in Qerberos, audit records in Qlock, and visibility in Qdashboard

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optionally register modules in sandbox mode for testing, so that I can validate the registration process without affecting production systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sandbox registration is requested THEN the system SHALL support a testMode parameter in the registration process
2. WHEN testMode is enabled THEN the system SHALL index the module in a sandbox tree accessible only to development identities
3. WHEN sandbox registration is complete THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the module is in test mode and not production-ready

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an ecosystem service, I want to access registered module information through standardized interfaces, so that I can integrate with and validate other modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module is registered THEN the system SHALL make module metadata accessible through QindexService queries
2. WHEN module information is requested THEN the system SHALL return complete metadata including signature verification status
3. WHEN module compatibility is checked THEN the system SHALL provide integration and dependency information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all module registrations to be properly audited and logged, so that I can track ecosystem changes and maintain regulatory compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN module registration occurs THEN the system SHALL log the event in Qerberos with complete audit trail
2. WHEN audit logging is performed THEN the system SHALL include registration timestamp, ROOT identity information, module details, and signature verification results
3. WHEN compliance reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide exportable audit records for regulatory review

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that failed registrations can be diagnosed and resolved efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with specific failure reasons
2. WHEN signature verification fails THEN the system SHALL indicate the specific validation issue and suggest resolution steps
3. WHEN network or service failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

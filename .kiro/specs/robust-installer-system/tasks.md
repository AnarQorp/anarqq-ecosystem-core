  - Create the missing `command_exists` function and other essential utilities
  - Set up proper shell script best practices with error trapping and cleanup
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 2. Implement dependency detection and installation system

  - Create functions to detect missing system utilities (unzip, curl, wget, git, node, npm)
  - Implement automatic installation using appropriate package managers (apt, yum, brew)
  - Add fallback mechanisms for manual installation with clear instructions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 3. Build robust download engine with multiple fallback methods

  - Implement git clone method as primary download approach
  - Create ZIP download methods using curl and wget with proper error handling
  - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for network operations
  - Implement multiple archive extraction methods (unzip, python, node-based)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 4. Create comprehensive error handling and logging system

  - Implement structured error logging with timestamps and context
  - Add proper cleanup mechanisms for failed installations
  - Create detailed error reporting with suggested solutions
  - Add verbose mode support for debugging
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6_

- [ ] 5. Implement cross-platform compatibility layer

  - Add operating system detection (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL)
  - Implement package manager detection and adaptation
  - Handle different path separators and permission models
  - Ensure shell compatibility across bash, zsh, and other shells
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Build modular installation options system

  - Create installation mode selection (minimal, full, development)
  - Implement component-specific installation logic
  - Add dependency validation between selected components
  - Include disk space checking and cleanup options
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6_

- [ ] 7. Develop interactive user interface and progress feedback

  - Implement progress indicators with current step and estimated time
  - Create clear user prompts with default options and explanations
  - Add progress bars for long-running operations
  - Implement graceful cancellation with cleanup
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6_

- [x] 8. Create post-installation validation and quick-start system

  - Implement comprehensive validation tests for all installed components
  - Add network connectivity and module loading tests
  - Create convenient startup scripts and shortcuts
  - Generate personalized quick-start guides based on installed components
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [x] 9. Fix current installer issues and integrate improvements

  - Fix the missing `command_exists` function in the existing installer
  - Add proper unzip dependency handling with fallback methods
  - Update repository download logic to handle public/private access
  - Test the improved installer with the user's specific environment
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.6, 3.2_

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive testing and documentation
  - Write unit tests for individual installer functions
  - Create integration tests for complete installation flows
  - Add platform-specific testing on Linux, macOS, and Windows WSL
  - Generate troubleshooting documentation and user guides
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.6, 6.4, 7.6_

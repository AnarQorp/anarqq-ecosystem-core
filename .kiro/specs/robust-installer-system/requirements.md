# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AnarQ&Q ecosystem requires a robust, cross-platform installer system that can handle various system configurations, network conditions, and dependency scenarios. The current installer has critical issues including missing functions, dependency failures, and poor error handling. This specification addresses the need for a production-grade installer that provides reliable, user-friendly installation across different environments with comprehensive error recovery and fallback mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user installing the AnarQ&Q ecosystem, I want the installer to automatically detect and install missing system dependencies, so that I don't have to manually troubleshoot prerequisite issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the installer runs THEN it SHALL detect missing system utilities (unzip, curl, wget, git, node, npm, docker)
2. WHEN a missing utility is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic installation using the appropriate package manager
3. WHEN automatic installation is not possible THEN the system SHALL provide clear, platform-specific installation instructions
4. WHEN all dependencies are satisfied THEN the system SHALL proceed with the main installation
5. IF any critical dependency cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL exit gracefully with detailed remediation steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with limited internet connectivity, I want multiple download methods and retry mechanisms, so that I can successfully install even with unreliable network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading repositories THEN the system SHALL attempt multiple methods: git clone, curl ZIP download, wget ZIP download
2. WHEN a download method fails THEN the system SHALL automatically try the next available method
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry with up to 3 attempts
4. WHEN ZIP extraction is needed THEN the system SHALL support multiple extraction methods: unzip, python zipfile, node-based extraction
5. WHEN all download methods fail THEN the system SHALL provide offline installation instructions and contact information
6. IF repositories are private THEN the system SHALL provide clear authentication setup instructions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve installation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to a timestamped log file
2. WHEN functions are called THEN all function definitions SHALL be validated before execution
3. WHEN critical operations execute THEN the system SHALL implement proper error trapping and cleanup
4. WHEN installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive error report with suggested solutions
5. WHEN cleanup is needed THEN the system SHALL remove partial installations and temporary files
6. IF debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support verbose mode with detailed step-by-step logging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on different operating systems, I want cross-platform compatibility, so that I can install the ecosystem regardless of my system configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the installer detects the OS THEN it SHALL adapt commands and paths for Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL)
2. WHEN package managers are used THEN the system SHALL support apt, yum, brew, chocolatey, and manual installation
3. WHEN file operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle different path separators and permission models
4. WHEN shell features are used THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with bash, zsh, and other common shells
5. WHEN Docker is available THEN the system SHALL provide containerized installation as an alternative
6. IF the platform is unsupported THEN the system SHALL provide manual installation documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular installation options, so that I can install only the components I need for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installation begins THEN the system SHALL offer installation modes: minimal demo, full ecosystem, development environment
2. WHEN minimal mode is selected THEN only core demo components SHALL be installed
3. WHEN full mode is selected THEN all 14 modules and backend services SHALL be installed
4. WHEN development mode is selected THEN additional development tools and test suites SHALL be included
5. WHEN components are selected THEN the system SHALL validate dependencies and suggest required additions
6. IF disk space is limited THEN the system SHALL provide space requirements and cleanup options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive guidance and progress feedback, so that I understand what's happening during installation and can make informed choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installation starts THEN the system SHALL display a clear progress indicator with current step and estimated time
2. WHEN user input is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear prompts with default options and explanations
3. WHEN long operations run THEN the system SHALL show progress bars or spinning indicators
4. WHEN choices are presented THEN the system SHALL explain the implications of each option
5. WHEN installation completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of installed components and next steps
6. IF the user wants to abort THEN the system SHALL allow graceful cancellation with cleanup

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want post-installation validation and quick-start options, so that I can immediately verify the installation worked and begin using the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installation completes THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive validation tests on all installed components
2. WHEN validation runs THEN it SHALL test network connectivity, module loading, and basic functionality
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL create convenient startup scripts and shortcuts
4. WHEN the system is ready THEN it SHALL provide multiple startup options: development server, production mode, Docker containers
5. WHEN documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL generate a personalized quick-start guide based on installed components
6. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps and support contact information

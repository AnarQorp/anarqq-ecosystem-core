# DAO Governance Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DAO Governance module enables users to participate in decentralized autonomous organizations within the AnarQ&Q ecosystem. Users can discover DAOs, join them, create proposals, vote on governance decisions, and manage their participation through a comprehensive interface that integrates with all Qâˆž ecosystem modules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: DAO Discovery and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to discover and join DAOs in the ecosystem, so that I can participate in decentralized governance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the DAO explorer THEN the system SHALL display all active DAOs with their metadata
2. WHEN a user views a DAO THEN the system SHALL show name, description, visibility, member count, and quorum requirements
3. WHEN a user requests to join a public DAO THEN the system SHALL evaluate access via Qonsent rules
4. IF the user meets token requirements THEN the system SHALL grant membership and log in Qindex
5. WHEN a user joins a DAO THEN the system SHALL update member count and notify via Qerberos

### Requirement 2: DAO Dashboard Interface

**User Story:** As a DAO member, I want to access a comprehensive dashboard for my DAO, so that I can manage proposals and participate in governance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a DAO dashboard THEN the system SHALL display detailed DAO information
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show all proposals with their current status
3. WHEN a user has proposal creation rights THEN the system SHALL display a "Create Proposal" button
4. IF the user is not a member THEN the system SHALL show join options and requirements
5. WHEN displaying proposals THEN the system SHALL show title, status, creator, and vote summary

### Requirement 3: Proposal Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a DAO member with rights, I want to create proposals, so that I can initiate governance decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Create Proposal" THEN the system SHALL verify their creation rights
2. IF the user has sufficient tokens/NFTs THEN the system SHALL display the proposal creation form
3. WHEN creating a proposal THEN the system SHALL require title, description, and voting options
4. WHEN a proposal is submitted THEN the system SHALL set duration, quorum, and log in Qindex
5. WHEN a proposal is created THEN the system SHALL notify members via Qsocial integration

### Requirement 4: Voting System

**User Story:** As a DAO member, I want to vote on active proposals, so that I can participate in governance decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing active proposals THEN the system SHALL show voting options and current results
2. WHEN a user votes THEN the system SHALL verify their membership and voting rights
3. IF using token-based voting THEN the system SHALL calculate vote weight from Qwallet balance
4. WHEN a vote is cast THEN the system SHALL sign with sQuid and validate via Qerberos
5. WHEN voting ends THEN the system SHALL tally results and determine if quorum was reached

### Requirement 5: Results and Analytics

**User Story:** As a DAO participant, I want to view voting results and DAO analytics, so that I can understand governance outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing completed proposals THEN the system SHALL display final vote tallies
2. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL break down votes by token type and identity
3. WHEN displaying analytics THEN the system SHALL show participation rates and trends
4. IF quorum was not reached THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate proposal failure
5. WHEN results are finalized THEN the system SHALL log outcomes in Qindex for auditability

### Requirement 6: Integration and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want DAO governance to integrate securely with all ecosystem modules, so that governance is transparent and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any DAO action occurs THEN the system SHALL authenticate via sQuid identity
2. WHEN evaluating access THEN the system SHALL use Qonsent privacy rules
3. WHEN validating votes THEN the system SHALL check token/NFT balances via Qwallet
4. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL record all actions in Qindex
5. WHEN detecting suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL validate via Qerberos

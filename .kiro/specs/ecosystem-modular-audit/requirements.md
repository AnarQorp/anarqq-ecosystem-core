# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the comprehensive audit and update of all Q ecosystem modules to ensure modular independence (standalone operation) and correlative interoperability through contracts/APIs/events. The goal is to prepare all modules for Qflow (serverless coherence layers) without breaking current deployment.

The scope includes: sQuid, Qwallet, Qlock, Qonsent, Qindex, Qerberos, Qmask, Qdrive, QpiC, Qmarket, Qmail, Qchat, QNET, DAO/Communities, and common utilities.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification expands the existing Qwallet module to provide a comprehensive, identity-aware, programmable wallet system within the AnarQ & Q ecosystem. The enhanced Qwallet will be fully integrated with sQuid identity management, providing secure, decentralized wallet functionality that adapts to different identity types (ROOT, DAO, ENTERPRISE, CONSENTIDA, AID) with appropriate permissions, limits, and governance rules.

This module builds upon an existing base where wallet context switching, per-identity limits, and identity-aware balance views have already been implemented and tested. The system extends this foundation with complete modular components, enhanced security controls, Pi Wallet compatibility, comprehensive audit capabilities, and future-proof support for modular token plugins and DAO-governed asset types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Identity-Aware Wallet Context System

**User Story:** As a user with multiple sQuid identities, I want each identity to have its own dedicated wallet context with appropriate permissions and limits, so that my wallet operations are properly governed by my active identity type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches between sQuid identities THEN the wallet context SHALL automatically switch to the corresponding identity's wallet
2. WHEN an identity is active THEN the wallet SHALL display only that identity's balances, transaction history, and available operations
3. WHEN a wallet operation is attempted THEN the system SHALL validate the operation against the active identity's permissions and limits
4. IF an identity type is ROOT THEN the wallet SHALL provide full access with maximum limits and admin capabilities
5. IF an identity type is DAO THEN the wallet SHALL limit operations to DAO-approved tokens and require governance for large transactions
6. IF an identity type is ENTERPRISE THEN the wallet SHALL restrict access to business-only tokens and prohibit DeFi operations
7. IF an identity type is CONSENTIDA THEN the wallet SHALL provide view-only access with capped spending and require parental approval
8. IF an identity type is AID THEN the wallet SHALL provide anonymous operation with single-token support, ephemeral sessions, and SHALL operate on ephemeral storage that self-destructs when session is lost or user logs out

### Requirement 2: Modular Wallet Components

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with Qwallet, I want reusable, identity-aware components that adapt to different identity types, so that I can build consistent wallet interfaces across the ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering the wallet dashboard THEN the component SHALL display identity-specific information including balances, limits, and permissions
2. WHEN displaying transaction history THEN the component SHALL show only transactions relevant to the active identity with appropriate privacy controls
3. WHEN rendering the token sender form THEN the component SHALL validate transfers against identity permissions and integrate with Qlock for signing
4. WHEN showing wallet limits THEN the component SHALL display visual indicators of usage, remaining limits, and permission status
5. WHEN integrating Pi Wallet THEN the component SHALL respect identity rules for external wallet linking
6. WHEN displaying audit status THEN the component SHALL show security risk flags and compliance status from Qerberos

### Requirement 3: Qlock and Qonsent Integration

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want all wallet transactions to be properly validated through Qonsent permissions and signed through Qlock, so that my wallet operations are secure and compliant with my privacy settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating a transaction THEN the system SHALL verify the action is permitted by the active identity's Qonsent profile
2. WHEN a transaction requires signing THEN the system SHALL use Qlock with the identity's cryptographic keys
3. WHEN Qonsent rules prohibit an operation THEN the system SHALL block the transaction and display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN identity permissions change THEN the wallet SHALL automatically update available operations and limits
5. WHEN a transaction is signed THEN the system SHALL validate the signature against the identity's public key
6. IF Qlock or Qonsent services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade with appropriate user notifications

### Requirement 4: Privacy and Security Controls

**User Story:** As a user with different privacy requirements across my identities, I want the wallet system to respect each identity's privacy level and security requirements, so that my financial activities are appropriately protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using an AID identity THEN the wallet SHALL not expose user metadata or link transactions to other identities
2. WHEN using a CONSENTIDA identity THEN the wallet SHALL require guardian signature approval for all transactions
3. WHEN transaction logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log only permitted information based on identity privacy settings
4. WHEN device validation is required THEN the system SHALL perform fingerprinting checks before allowing sensitive operations
5. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL flag the activity through Qerberos and apply appropriate restrictions
6. IF privacy level is ANONYMOUS THEN transaction metadata SHALL be minimized and not stored long-term

### Requirement 5: Pi Wallet Compatibility

**User Story:** As a Pi Network user, I want to link my Pi Wallet to appropriate sQuid identities for seamless token transfers, so that I can manage both ecosystems from a unified interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linking Pi Wallet THEN the system SHALL validate the identity type allows external wallet connections
2. WHEN Pi Wallet is linked THEN the interface SHALL display Pi balances alongside native tokens
3. WHEN transferring to/from Pi Wallet THEN the system SHALL respect identity transfer limits and permissions
4. IF identity type is AID or CONSENTIDA THEN Pi Wallet linking SHALL be blocked with appropriate messaging
5. WHEN Pi Wallet is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display connection status and provide fallback options
6. WHEN displaying Pi Wallet data THEN the interface SHALL clearly distinguish between native and Pi Network assets

### Requirement 6: State Management and Hooks Integration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want comprehensive hooks and state management for wallet operations, so that I can build responsive interfaces that automatically update when identity context changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identity switches occur THEN all wallet-related hooks SHALL automatically update with new identity's data
2. WHEN wallet state changes THEN subscribed components SHALL re-render with updated information
3. WHEN multiple components access wallet data THEN the state SHALL be consistent across all components
4. WHEN network requests are in progress THEN loading states SHALL be properly managed and displayed
5. WHEN errors occur THEN error states SHALL be captured and made available to consuming components
6. IF wallet operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for user feedback

### Requirement 7: Audit, Risk, and Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive logging and risk assessment of all wallet operations, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and detect suspicious activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wallet operations occur THEN the system SHALL log to Qerberos with appropriate severity levels and metadata
2. WHEN identity security levels change THEN the wallet SHALL adjust logging and monitoring accordingly
3. WHEN suspicious behavior is detected THEN the system SHALL flag activities including limit violations, rapid switching, and high frequency operations
4. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN they SHALL be structured for indexing by Qindex
5. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL provide exportable audit trails
6. IF risk thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL automatically apply protective measures and notify administrators

### Requirement 8: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all wallet components and identity interactions, so that I can ensure system reliability and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running component tests THEN all wallet components SHALL be tested against all identity types
2. WHEN testing permissions THEN the system SHALL validate correct enforcement of identity-based restrictions
3. WHEN testing identity switching THEN the system SHALL verify proper context updates and data isolation
4. WHEN testing transaction rejections THEN the system SHALL validate proper handling of Qonsent, governance, and security rule violations
5. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test interactions with Qlock, Qonsent, and Qerberos services
6. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information for debugging

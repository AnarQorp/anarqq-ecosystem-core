# DAO Dashboard Enhancement Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DAO Dashboard Enhancement extends the existing DAO governance interface by integrating real-time economic and reputational data for improved decision-making and member engagement. This enhancement adds wallet integration, token/NFT displays, enhanced proposal metrics, and economic analytics to provide a comprehensive governance experience within the AnarQ&Q ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: DAO Token Overview Panel

**User Story:** As a DAO member, I want to view comprehensive token information for my DAO, so that I can understand the economic structure and make informed governance decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a DAO dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the DAO's governance token details
2. WHEN showing token information THEN the system SHALL display token name, symbol, total supply, and circulating supply
3. WHEN displaying token metrics THEN the system SHALL show number of token holders
4. WHEN showing governance type THEN the system SHALL indicate if voting is user-based, token-weighted, or NFT-weighted
5. WHEN token data is unavailable from DAO service THEN the system SHALL fetch from QwalletService as fallback

### Requirement 2: Member Wallet Summary

**User Story:** As an authenticated DAO member, I want to view my wallet balance and voting power, so that I can understand my governance influence and economic stake.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user is authenticated and a DAO member THEN the system SHALL display their DAO token balance
2. WHEN showing wallet summary THEN the system SHALL display DAO-issued NFT count and details
3. WHEN calculating voting power THEN the system SHALL show voting weight based on token balance or NFT count
4. WHEN user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL show appropriate authentication prompts
5. WHEN user is not a member THEN the system SHALL display membership requirements instead

### Requirement 3: Quick Actions Panel

**User Story:** As a DAO member with appropriate permissions, I want quick access to wallet actions, so that I can efficiently manage my DAO participation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user has moderator/admin permissions THEN the system SHALL display "Mint NFT" button
2. WHEN user has tokens THEN the system SHALL display "Transfer Token" button with popup form
3. WHEN user has NFTs THEN the system SHALL display "View NFT Gallery" button opening gallery modal
4. WHEN user lacks permissions THEN the system SHALL show appropriate permission messages
5. WHEN actions are performed THEN the system SHALL refresh wallet data and update displays

### Requirement 4: Proposal Quorum Stats Summary

**User Story:** As a DAO participant, I want to view historical quorum statistics, so that I can understand governance participation patterns and effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing DAO dashboard THEN the system SHALL display percentage of proposals that reached quorum
2. WHEN showing proposal stats THEN the system SHALL list most voted proposals with titles and vote percentages
3. WHEN calculating metrics THEN the system SHALL show average time-to-quorum when data is available
4. WHEN displaying stats THEN the system SHALL use data from past proposals via getProposals() and getResults()
5. WHEN insufficient data exists THEN the system SHALL show appropriate "not enough data" messages

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Proposal Metrics

**User Story:** As a DAO member reviewing proposals, I want detailed voting metrics, so that I can better understand proposal support and participation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing proposals THEN the system SHALL show voting weight breakdown for token/NFT-weighted voting
2. WHEN displaying proposal details THEN the system SHALL show total number of unique voters
3. WHEN showing proposal status THEN the system SHALL indicate quorum status (achieved/pending/missed)
4. WHEN proposal voting is complete THEN the system SHALL display final participation metrics
5. WHEN extending ProposalCard THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing props

### Requirement 6: Responsive Layout and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user accessing the DAO dashboard on various devices, I want a responsive and accessible interface, so that I can participate in governance regardless of my device or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a 2-column layout with DAO info on left and economic data on right
2. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL stack components vertically with appropriate spacing
3. WHEN using assistive technology THEN the system SHALL provide WCAG 2.1 compliant accessibility features
4. WHEN displaying charts THEN the system SHALL use accessible color schemes and provide alternative text
5. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum 44px touch targets

### Requirement 7: Permissions and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper access control for economic features, so that sensitive wallet operations are restricted to authorized users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user attempts token/NFT actions THEN the system SHALL verify moderator, admin, or owner roles
2. WHEN user lacks permissions THEN the system SHALL display clear fallback messages explaining requirements
3. WHEN showing wallet data THEN the system SHALL only display information for authenticated members
4. WHEN performing wallet operations THEN the system SHALL validate permissions before API calls
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security events appropriately

### Requirement 8: Integration and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the enhanced dashboard to load quickly and integrate seamlessly with existing systems, so that my governance experience is smooth and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading dashboard THEN the system SHALL fetch wallet and DAO data in parallel for optimal performance
2. WHEN integrating with useQwallet THEN the system SHALL use existing hooks without breaking changes
3. WHEN updating displays THEN the system SHALL use efficient state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. WHEN showing charts THEN the system SHALL use lightweight visualization libraries (recharts or Tailwind bars)
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality while maintaining core DAO features

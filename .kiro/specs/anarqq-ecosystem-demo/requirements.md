# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AnarQ&Q ecosystem demo is a comprehensive demonstration platform that showcases the complete integration and functionality of all core modules within the AnarQ&Q decentralized ecosystem. This demo serves as a production-ready validation system that demonstrates real-world data flows, module interactions, and Pi Network integration capabilities. The system must operate in a fully decentralized manner with no central servers, providing reproducible outputs and meeting strict performance criteria for latency, throughput, and error rates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential adopter, I want to see all core AnarQ&Q modules working together seamlessly, so that I can understand the complete ecosystem capabilities and integration patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the demo is launched THEN the system SHALL integrate all 14 core modules: sQuid, Qlock, Qonsent, Qindex, Qerberos, Qwallet, Qflow, QNET, Qdrive, QpiC, Qmarket, Qmail, Qchat, and Qsocial
2. WHEN any module is accessed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate its functionality within the broader ecosystem context
3. WHEN modules interact THEN the system SHALL show clear data flow visualization between components
4. IF any core module fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and fallback options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a technical evaluator, I want to validate Q∞ data flows end-to-end, so that I can verify the integrity and security of the data processing pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data enters the system THEN it SHALL follow the exact flow: data → Qompress → Qlock → Qindex → Qerberos → IPFS
2. WHEN data is retrieved THEN it SHALL follow the exact flow: IPFS → Qindex → Qerberos → Qlock → Qompress → user
3. WHEN each step processes data THEN the system SHALL log and display the transformation for validation
4. WHEN the complete flow executes THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity at each checkpoint
5. IF any step in the flow fails THEN the system SHALL halt processing and provide detailed error diagnostics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a demo presenter, I want pre-configured representative scenarios, so that I can showcase different use cases effectively to various audiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the demo orchestrator starts THEN it SHALL provide 3 distinct scenarios: identity flow, content flow, and DAO flow
2. WHEN the identity flow runs THEN it SHALL demonstrate user registration, authentication, and identity verification through sQuid and Qerberos
3. WHEN the content flow runs THEN it SHALL demonstrate content creation, storage via Qdrive, indexing via Qindex, and retrieval
4. WHEN the DAO flow runs THEN it SHALL demonstrate governance proposal creation, voting, and execution through integrated modules
5. WHEN the social flow runs THEN it SHALL demonstrate Qsocial community interactions and governance links
5. WHEN any scenario executes THEN it SHALL run on QNET Phase 2 with external nodes for true decentralization
6. IF external nodes are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear messaging about network requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Pi Network user, I want full integration with Pi ecosystem, so that I can use my existing Pi identity and wallet seamlessly within AnarQ&Q.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL support Pi Wallet authentication as the primary method
2. WHEN smart contracts execute THEN they SHALL run through Qflow with Pi Network compatibility
3. WHEN identity linking occurs THEN sQuid SHALL securely connect Pi identity with AnarQ&Q identity
4. WHEN Pi transactions occur THEN they SHALL be processed through the integrated Qwallet system
5. IF Pi Network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative authentication methods with clear messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer or user, I want comprehensive bilingual documentation, so that I can understand, set up, and troubleshoot the system in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL be available in both English and Spanish
2. WHEN setup is performed THEN /docs/demo SHALL contain complete installation and configuration guides
3. WHEN Pi integration is configured THEN /docs/pi SHALL contain specific Pi Network setup instructions
4. WHEN issues occur THEN troubleshooting guides SHALL provide step-by-step resolution procedures
5. WHEN workflows are followed THEN documentation SHALL include visual diagrams and code examples
6. IF documentation is missing for any component THEN the system SHALL generate placeholder documentation with basic information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, production-ready repository with automated deployment, so that I can quickly set up and run the demo environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is accessed THEN it SHALL be hosted as a private repository under AnarQorp organization
2. WHEN deployment begins THEN docker-compose SHALL orchestrate all required services
3. WHEN setup runs THEN automated scripts SHALL configure all modules and dependencies
4. WHEN validation executes THEN scripts SHALL verify system integrity and readiness
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL be production-ready with no development artifacts
6. IF any deployment step fails THEN scripts SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want decentralized operation with performance guarantees, so that I can ensure the demo meets enterprise-grade standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL function without any central servers or single points of failure
2. WHEN performance is measured THEN latency SHALL not exceed 2 seconds for any user operation
3. WHEN throughput is tested THEN the system SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent users
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the error rate SHALL not exceed 1% under normal operating conditions
5. WHEN outputs are generated THEN they SHALL be reproducible across multiple runs with identical inputs
6. WHEN decentralization is verified THEN all critical functions SHALL operate with distributed nodes only
7. IF performance thresholds are not met THEN the system SHALL provide performance optimization recommendations

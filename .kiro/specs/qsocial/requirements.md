# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Qsocial is a decentralized social platform module for the AnarQ ecosystem that functions as a Reddit-style community hub. It serves as both a standalone social platform and a central dashboard that aggregates content from other AnarQ modules (QpiC, Qmail, Qmarket, etc.). The platform enables users to create posts, comment, vote, organize content into subcommunities, and interact using decentralized identities with reputation-based governance.

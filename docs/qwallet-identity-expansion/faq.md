# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the Qwallet Identity Expansion?

The Qwallet Identity Expansion is an enhanced wallet system that provides identity-aware financial operations within the AnarQ & Q ecosystem. Each sQuid identity (ROOT, DAO, ENTERPRISE, CONSENTIDA, AID) has its own dedicated wallet context with appropriate permissions, limits, and governance rules.

### How does identity-aware wallet context work?

When you switch between sQuid identities, the wallet automatically switches to that identity's dedicated context. Each identity has its own:
- Token balances and transaction history
- Permission levels and spending limits
- Security settings and privacy controls
- Audit logging and compliance requirements

### What identity types are supported?

- **ROOT**: Full administrative access with maximum privileges
- **DAO**: Collective governance with DAO-approved operations
- **ENTERPRISE**: Business-focused operations with compliance controls
- **CONSENTIDA**: Minor-friendly interface with guardian oversight
- **AID**: Anonymous operations with privacy-first design

## Technical Questions

### How do I integrate Qwallet into my application?

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install @anarq/qwallet @anarq/squid @anarq/qlock @anarq/qonsent
   ```

2. Set up the providers:
   ```tsx
   import { IdentityProvider } from '@anarq/squid';
   import { QwalletProvider } from '@anarq/qwallet';
   
   function App() {
     return (
       <IdentityProvider>
         <QwalletProvider>
           <YourApp />
         </QwalletProvider>
       </IdentityProvider>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Use the wallet components:
   ```tsx
   import { WalletDashboard } from '@anarq/qwallet';
   
   function WalletPage() {
     const { activeIdentity } = useIdentityManager();
     return <WalletDashboard identityId={activeIdentity.id} />;
   }
   ```

### What services does Qwallet integrate with?

- **Qlock**: Transaction signing and key management
- **Qonsent**: Permission validation and policy enforcement
- **Qerberos**: Audit logging and security monitoring
- **Qindex**: Transaction indexing and search
- **Pi Wallet**: Pi Network integration (optional)

### How are transactions signed and validated?

1. **Permission Check**: Qonsent validates the operation against identity permissions
2. **Limit Validation**: System checks transaction against identity limits
3. **Risk Assessment**: Security system evaluates transaction risk
4. **Signing**: Qlock signs the transaction with identity's private key
5. **Execution**: Transaction is executed and logged to Qerberos

### Can I use Qwallet without all the ecosystem services?

Qwallet requires Qlock for signing and Qonsent for permissions. Qerberos is highly recommended for audit logging. Pi Wallet integration is optional. The system will gracefully degrade if optional services are unavailable.

## Identity-Specific Questions

### ROOT Identity

**Q: What can I do with ROOT identity that others cannot?**
A: ROOT identity provides:
- Unlimited transaction limits
- Administrative controls over other identities
- Emergency wallet freeze/unfreeze capabilities
- System-wide monitoring and reporting
- Access to all tokens and operations

**Q: How do I enable multi-signature for ROOT transactions?**
A: Configure multi-signature in your wallet settings:
```tsx
const config = {
  multiSigThreshold: 1000000, // Amount requiring multi-sig
  requiredSigners: 3,
  signerAddresses: ['0x...', '0x...', '0x...']
};
await walletService.updateSecuritySettings(identityId, config);
```

### DAO Identity

**Q: How are DAO wallet limits determined?**
A: DAO limits are set through governance proposals. Members vote on:
- Daily/monthly spending limits
- Approved token lists
- Large transaction thresholds
- Emergency procedures

**Q: What happens if I try to exceed DAO limits?**
A: Transactions exceeding limits are either:
- Automatically rejected (for hard limits)
- Queued for governance approval (for soft limits)
- Flagged for community review

### ENTERPRISE Identity

**Q: What compliance features are available for enterprises?**
A: Enterprise identities include:
- Enhanced audit logging
- Compliance report generation
- Multi-signature requirements
- Regulatory reporting tools
- Risk assessment dashboards

**Q: Can enterprises customize their wallet interface?**
A: Yes, enterprises can:
- Brand the wallet interface
- Add custom compliance workflows
- Integrate with existing business systems
- Configure custom approval processes

### CONSENTIDA Identity

**Q: How does guardian approval work?**
A: For CONSENTIDA identities:
1. Minor initiates transaction
2. System notifies guardian(s)
3. Guardian reviews and approves/denies
4. Transaction executes only after approval
5. All actions are logged for transparency

**Q: What educational features are available?**
A: CONSENTIDA wallets include:
- Transaction explanations and tooltips
- Spending limit visualizations
- Financial literacy resources
- Safe transaction practices guides

### AID Identity

**Q: How does anonymous operation work?**
A: AID identities provide:
- No persistent storage of personal data
- Ephemeral sessions that self-destruct
- Minimal transaction metadata
- Single-token support for simplicity
- No cross-identity data linking

**Q: What are the limitations of AID identities?**
A: AID identities have:
- Limited token support (usually one token type)
- Lower transaction limits
- No transaction history persistence
- No Pi Wallet integration
- Restricted audit capabilities

## Security Questions

### How secure is the wallet system?

The wallet system implements multiple security layers:
- **Identity-based access control**: Each identity has specific permissions
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Through sQuid identity system
- **Transaction signing**: All transactions signed with Qlock
- **Audit logging**: Complete transaction history in Qerberos
- **Risk assessment**: Real-time security monitoring
- **Emergency controls**: Ability to freeze wallets if needed

### What happens if my device is compromised?

If you suspect device compromise:
1. **Immediately freeze your wallet** (if you have access)
2. **Contact emergency support** using emergency procedures
3. **Change your identity credentials** through sQuid system
4. **Review recent transactions** for unauthorized activity
5. **Re-authenticate from a secure device**

### How are private keys managed?

Private keys are managed by the Qlock service:
- Keys are derived from your sQuid identity
- Keys are encrypted and stored securely
- Each identity has separate key pairs
- Hardware security module support available
- Key rotation policies are enforced

## Pi Wallet Integration

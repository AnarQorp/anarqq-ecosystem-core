# Q∞ (Q-Infinity) Architecture

## Introduction

The Q∞ (Q-Infinity) architecture is the foundational framework that powers the entire AnarQ&Q ecosystem. This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the architecture, its components, design principles, and implementation details.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Principles

The Q∞ architecture is built on five fundamental principles:

1. **Infinite Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across multiple chains and networks
2. **Universal Interoperability**: Seamless communication between all components
3. **Modular Composability**: Independent modules that work together seamlessly
4. **Self-Sovereign Identity**: User-controlled identity across all services
5. **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decision making

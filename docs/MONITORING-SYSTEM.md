## Usage

### Basic Monitoring

```bash
# Run enhanced monitoring
npm run docs:monitor:enhanced

# View current status
npm run docs:monitor:status

# Run automated monitoring with full integration
npm run docs:monitor:automated
```

### Specific Commands

```bash
# Enhanced monitoring with detailed output
node scripts/docs-monitoring-system-enhanced.mjs monitor

# View alerts with details
node scripts/docs-monitoring-system-enhanced.mjs alerts

# View recommendations with actions
node scripts/docs-monitoring-system-enhanced.mjs recommendations

# View trends analysis
node scripts/docs-monitoring-system-enhanced.mjs trends

# Run automation integration
node scripts/docs-monitoring-automation-integration.mjs run
```

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
# In your CI/CD pipeline
npm run docs:monitor:automated

# Check exit code for build decisions
echo $? # 0 = pass, 1 = fail
```

## Configuration

### Monitoring Thresholds

The system uses configurable thresholds for different metrics:

```javascript
thresholds: {
  documentFreshness: 90,     // days
  linkHealthScore: 95,       // percentage
  bilingualCoverage: 80,     // percentage
  reviewBacklogDays: 14,     // days
  contentCoverage: 90,       // percentage
  openApiCoverage: 70,       // percentage
  mcpCoverage: 60,           // percentage
  qualityScore: 85           // percentage
}
```

### Alert Levels

- **Critical** (< 60%): Immediate action required, can fail CI/CD
- **Warning** (60-80%): Attention needed, may fail CI/CD if configured
- **Info** (80-90%): Informational, tracking purposes
- **Good** (> 90%): Healthy status

### Automation Integration

```javascript
automationIntegration: {
  reportingSchedule: 'daily',    // daily, weekly, monthly
  alertThresholds: {
    critical: 60,
    warning: 80,
    info: 90
  },
  cicd: {
    failOnCritical: true,
    failOnWarning: false,
    generateArtifacts: true
  }
}
```

- Automated validation tools caught 95% of data issues
- Sample-based validation provided good coverage with acceptable performance

**Backup and Recovery**
- Comprehensive backup strategy provided confidence during migration

- Data archival process preserved historical information effectively

#### What Could Be Improved

**Performance Optimization**
- Initial data migration was slower than expected
- Parallel processing could have been implemented earlier
- Network bandwidth became a bottleneck during peak migration periods

**Data Transformation**
- Some legacy data formats required more complex transformations
- Data quality issues in legacy systems caused migration delays
- Schema evolution during migration created additional complexity

### 5. Security and Compliance

#### What Worked Well

**Security by Design**
- Implementing security controls from the start prevented retrofitting
- Automated security scanning caught vulnerabilities early
- Compliance validation was built into the migration process

**Key Management**
- Centralized key management simplified security operations
- Automated key rotation reduced operational overhead
- Environment-specific key scoping prevented security issues

#### What Could Be Improved

**Compliance Documentation**
- Audit trail documentation needed more automation
- Compliance reporting required manual effort
- Some regulatory requirements were clarified late in the process

## Core Concepts

### AnarQ&Q
The foundational philosophy and framework underlying the Q∞ ecosystem, emphasizing decentralization, privacy, and user sovereignty.

### Q∞ Ecosystem
The complete integrated system of 14 modules that form the AnarQ&Q platform, providing comprehensive digital services while maintaining privacy and decentralization principles.

### Q∞ Architecture
The technical architecture that enables seamless integration and communication between all modules in the ecosystem while maintaining modularity and independence.

### Module
An independent, self-contained component of the Q∞ ecosystem that provides specific functionality and can operate standalone or integrated with other modules.

### Ecosystem Integration
The process and mechanisms by which modules communicate, share data, and coordinate functionality within the Q∞ ecosystem.

### Modular Design
The architectural principle that allows each module to function independently while providing standardized interfaces for integration with other modules.

## Technical Terms

### API (Application Programming Interface)
Standardized interface that allows modules to communicate and share functionality with each other and external systems.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Protocol used for serverless integration and communication between modules and AI/ML systems.

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
Distributed file system used for decentralized storage and content addressing within the ecosystem.

### Blockchain Integration
The connection and interaction mechanisms between Q∞ modules and various blockchain networks.

### Microservices Architecture
The architectural pattern where each module operates as an independent service with its own database and business logic.

### Event-Driven Architecture
System design where modules communicate through events, enabling loose coupling and scalability.

### Containerization
The use of Docker containers to package and deploy modules consistently across different environments.

## Architecture Terms

### Module Registry
Central system that tracks available modules, their versions, capabilities, and integration endpoints.

### Service Discovery
Mechanism by which modules locate and connect to other modules within the ecosystem.

### Load Balancing
Distribution of requests across multiple instances of modules to ensure optimal performance and availability.

### Circuit Breaker
Pattern used to prevent cascading failures when one module becomes unavailable or unresponsive.

### API Gateway
Central entry point that routes requests to appropriate modules and handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication and rate limiting.

### Message Queue
Asynchronous communication mechanism that enables modules to exchange messages without direct coupling.

### Configuration Management
System for managing and distributing configuration settings across all modules in the ecosystem.

## Integration Terms

### Cross-Module Communication
The methods and protocols used for modules to exchange data and coordinate functionality.

### Data Synchronization
Process of keeping data consistent across multiple modules that share or depend on the same information.

### Webhook
HTTP callback mechanism used by modules to notify other modules of events or state changes.

### Event Bus
Central communication channel that allows modules to publish and subscribe to events across the ecosystem.

### Integration Endpoint
Specific API endpoint designed for inter-module communication and data exchange.

### Dependency Injection
Design pattern used to manage dependencies between modules and external services.

### Service Mesh
Infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication, security, and observability.

## Development Terms

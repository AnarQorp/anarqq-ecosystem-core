# Content Security and Sanitization Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security guidelines and procedures for managing sensitive information in the AnarQ&Q ecosystem documentation. It provides comprehensive rules for content sanitization, classification, and access control to ensure that sensitive information is properly protected while maintaining useful documentation.

## Content Classification System

### Classification Levels

#### PUBLIC
- **Description:** Publicly accessible content that can be shared openly
- **Audience:** General public, developers, users
- **Examples:** User guides, API documentation, tutorials, changelogs
- **Restrictions:** None
- **Distribution:** Can be published on public websites, repositories, and documentation portals

#### PARTNER
- **Description:** Content intended for business partners and enterprise customers
- **Audience:** Verified partners, enterprise customers, integration developers
- **Examples:** Advanced integration guides, enterprise features, B2B API documentation
- **Restrictions:** Requires partner access verification
- **Distribution:** Partner portals, authenticated documentation sites

#### INTERNAL
- **Description:** Confidential content for internal team use only
- **Audience:** Internal development team, administrators, security personnel
- **Examples:** Security implementations, internal processes, confidential business information
- **Restrictions:** Internal access only, no external sharing
- **Distribution:** Internal wikis, private repositories, team documentation systems

### Automatic Classification Rules

The content classification system uses pattern matching to automatically categorize content:

#### INTERNAL Indicators
- Security implementation details
- Private keys, tokens, or credentials
- Internal infrastructure information
- Confidential business processes
- Development/staging environment details
- Vulnerability information

#### PARTNER Indicators
- Advanced integration documentation
- Enterprise feature descriptions
- B2B API specifications
- Technical architecture details
- Performance optimization guides
- White-label customization options

#### PUBLIC Indicators
- Getting started guides
- Basic feature documentation
- Community resources
- Open source information
- General tutorials and examples
- FAQ and support content

## Content Sanitization Rules

### Sensitive Information Detection

The following types of sensitive information are automatically detected and flagged:

#### 1. Authentication Credentials
- **API Keys:** `api_key`, `apikey`, `access_token`, `bearer` tokens
- **Database Credentials:** Usernames, passwords in connection strings
- **Private Keys:** RSA, EC, OpenSSH private keys
- **Certificates:** SSL/TLS certificates and certificate authorities

#### 2. Infrastructure Information
- **Private IP Addresses:** RFC 1918 private IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x, 192.168.x.x)
- **Internal Endpoints:** localhost, .local domains, development/staging URLs
- **Database URLs:** Connection strings with embedded credentials

#### 3. Personal Information
- **Email Addresses:** Real email addresses (excluding example.com)
- **Phone Numbers:** Phone numbers in various formats
- **Personal Identifiers:** Social security numbers, credit card numbers

#### 4. Blockchain/Crypto Information
- **Wallet Addresses:** Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrency addresses
- **Private Keys:** Blockchain private keys and mnemonics
- **Transaction IDs:** Sensitive transaction identifiers

### Sanitization Procedures

#### Automatic Sanitization
When sensitive content is detected, it is automatically replaced with safe alternatives:

```bash
# Original sensitive content
api_key: sk_live_abc123def456ghi789

# Sanitized content
api_key: [REDACTED-API-KEY]
```

#### Replacement Patterns
- **API Keys:** `[REDACTED-API-KEY]`
- **Passwords:** `[REDACTED]`
- **Private Keys:** `[REDACTED-PRIVATE-KEY]` (preserving key structure)
- **IP Addresses:** `192.0.2.1` (RFC 5737 example IP)
- **Email Addresses:** `user@example.com`
- **Phone Numbers:** `+1-555-0123`
- **URLs:** `https://example.com`

#### Preservation Rules
The following content is preserved and not sanitized:
- Example domains (example.com, example.org)
- Placeholder syntax (`${API_KEY}`, `process.env.API_KEY`)
- Bracketed placeholders (`[your-api-key]`, `{api-key}`)
- Already redacted content (containing `***` or `[REDACTED]`)
- Documentation examples clearly marked as examples

## Security Scanning Process

### Automated Scanning

#### Daily Scans
- All documentation is scanned daily for sensitive information
- Scan results are logged and reviewed by the security team
- Critical and high-severity issues trigger immediate alerts

#### Pre-commit Scanning
- All documentation changes are scanned before commit
- Commits containing sensitive information are blocked
- Developers receive immediate feedback on security issues

#### Release Scanning
- Complete security scan before each release
- No releases are approved with unresolved security issues
- Security clearance required for all public documentation

### Manual Review Process

#### Security Review Requirements
- All INTERNAL classified documents require security team review
- PARTNER documents require business stakeholder approval
- PUBLIC documents require technical review for accuracy

#### Review Checklist
- [ ] No sensitive credentials or keys exposed
- [ ] No internal infrastructure details revealed
- [ ] No confidential business information included
- [ ] Appropriate classification level assigned
- [ ] Access controls properly configured
- [ ] Sanitization rules applied correctly

## Access Control Implementation

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Public Role
- **Access:** PUBLIC classified content only
- **Permissions:** Read-only access to public documentation
- **Authentication:** None required

#### Partner Role
- **Access:** PUBLIC and PARTNER classified content
- **Permissions:** Read access to partner documentation
- **Authentication:** Partner portal login required
- **Verification:** Business relationship verification

#### Internal Role
- **Access:** All classification levels (PUBLIC, PARTNER, INTERNAL)
- **Permissions:** Read/write access based on team role
- **Authentication:** Internal SSO required
- **Authorization:** Team membership verification

### Technical Implementation

#### File-Level Access Control
```json
{
  "file": "/docs/internal/security-implementation.md",
  "classification": "INTERNAL",
  "allowedRoles": ["internal"],
  "restrictions": ["no_external_sharing", "audit_access"]
}
```

#### Directory-Level Rules
- `/docs/public/` - Public access
- `/docs/partner/` - Partner access required
- `/docs/internal/` - Internal access only
- `/docs/security/` - Security team access only

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Types

#### Data Exposure Incidents
- Sensitive information found in public documentation
- Credentials accidentally committed to public repositories
- Internal information leaked through public channels

#### Access Control Violations
- Unauthorized access to classified content
- Improper sharing of restricted documentation
- Bypass of access control mechanisms

### Response Procedures

#### Immediate Response (0-1 hours)
1. **Assess Impact:** Determine scope and severity of exposure
2. **Contain Breach:** Remove or sanitize exposed content immediately
3. **Notify Stakeholders:** Alert security team and affected parties
4. **Document Incident:** Create incident report with timeline

#### Short-term Response (1-24 hours)
1. **Investigate Root Cause:** Identify how the incident occurred
2. **Implement Fixes:** Address vulnerabilities that led to incident
3. **Update Procedures:** Revise processes to prevent recurrence
4. **Communicate Status:** Provide updates to stakeholders

#### Long-term Response (1-7 days)
1. **Conduct Post-mortem:** Analyze incident and response effectiveness
2. **Update Training:** Enhance security awareness training
3. **Improve Tools:** Enhance automated detection and prevention
4. **Monitor for Impact:** Watch for any ongoing security implications

## Compliance and Auditing

### Best Practices

#### Content Creation
1. **Think Before You Write:** Consider classification level before creating content
2. **Use Placeholders:** Always use example data instead of real credentials
3. **Review Before Publishing:** Double-check content for sensitive information
4. **Follow Templates:** Use approved templates that include security considerations

#### Content Maintenance
1. **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review existing content for security issues
2. **Update Classifications:** Adjust classification levels as content evolves
3. **Monitor Access:** Review who has access to classified content
4. **Archive Outdated Content:** Remove or archive content that's no longer needed

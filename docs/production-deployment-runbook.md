## Blue-Green Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Green Environment Preparation

1. **Deploy to Green Environment**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   export DEPLOYMENT_ENV=green
   export TARGET_VERSION=v1.0.0
   
   # Deploy all modules to green environment
   ./scripts/deploy-ecosystem.sh --env=green --version=$TARGET_VERSION
   ```

2. **Validate Green Environment**
   ```bash
   # Run health checks
   ./scripts/health-check.sh --env=green
   
   # Run smoke tests
   npm run test:smoke -- --env=green
   
   # Validate SLO compliance
   ./scripts/validate-slos.sh --env=green
   ```

3. **Load Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run load tests against green environment
   npm run test:load -- --env=green --duration=10m
   
   # Validate performance metrics
   ./scripts/validate-performance.sh --env=green
   ```

### Phase 2: Traffic Switching

1. **Gradual Traffic Shift**
   ```bash
   # Start with 10% traffic to green
   ./scripts/traffic-split.sh --green=10 --blue=90
   
   # Monitor for 15 minutes
   sleep 900
   
   # Increase to 50% if metrics are healthy
   ./scripts/traffic-split.sh --green=50 --blue=50
   
   # Monitor for 15 minutes
   sleep 900
   
   # Complete switch to green if all metrics pass
   ./scripts/traffic-split.sh --green=100 --blue=0
   ```

2. **Monitoring During Switch**
   ```bash
   # Monitor key metrics during traffic switch
   ./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh --duration=30m
   ```

### Phase 3: Blue Environment Cleanup

1. **Validate Green Environment Stability**
   ```bash
   # Monitor green environment for 1 hour
   ./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh --env=green --duration=60m
   ```

2. **Decommission Blue Environment**
   ```bash
   # Keep blue environment for 24 hours for quick rollback
   # Then decommission
   ./scripts/decommission-environment.sh --env=blue --delay=24h
   ```

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)

1. **Emergency Traffic Switch**
   ```bash
   # Immediately switch all traffic back to blue
   ./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh --target=blue
   
   # This should complete within 30 seconds
   ```

2. **Validate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Verify blue environment is healthy
   ./scripts/health-check.sh --env=blue
   
   # Run smoke tests
   npm run test:smoke -- --env=blue
   ```

### Planned Rollback (< 15 minutes)

1. **Gradual Traffic Shift Back**
   ```bash
   # Reduce green traffic to 50%
   ./scripts/traffic-split.sh --green=50 --blue=50
   
   # Monitor for issues
   sleep 300
   
   # Complete rollback to blue
   ./scripts/traffic-split.sh --green=0 --blue=100
   ```

2. **Post-Rollback Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Collect logs and metrics from failed deployment
   ./scripts/collect-deployment-logs.sh --env=green --incident-id=$INCIDENT_ID
   
   # Generate rollback report
   ./scripts/generate-rollback-report.sh --incident-id=$INCIDENT_ID
   ```

   # Validate content availability
   ./scripts/validate-ipfs-content.sh
   ```

### Infrastructure Recovery

1. **Multi-Region Failover**

   ```

2. **Service Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Deploy ecosystem to recovery infrastructure
